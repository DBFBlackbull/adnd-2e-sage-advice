#148-8">🔗</a><br/><strong>According to page 13, any warrior with a strength score of 16 or more gets a 10% bonus to experience. But later on, in the descriptions of the paladin and ranger, the rules say that members of these classes must have other high ability scores to get the bonus. Which is correct?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The text on page 13 is a misprint. Fighters get the 10% for a strength score of 16 or better; paladins and rangers must have additional high ability scores.</span>

#148-10">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a fighter specialize with more than one weapon?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;No, but he can "save" additional slots as he earns them and specialize with a weapon later in his career if he doesn't fill those slots at the start.</span>
  </p>

#148-11">🔗</a><br/><strong>Do demihuman fighters get to roll for extraordinary strength?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Yes; all warrior characters are entitled to exceptional strength rolls if they have strength scores of 18.</span>
  </p>
  <p id="148-12">Sage Advice #148 (August 1989) p. 10+12, Question:12
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('148-12')" title="Copy to clipboard">📋</button>&ensp;<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DBFBlackbull/adnd-2e-sage-advice/blob/master/html/index.html
#148-12">🔗</a><br/><strong>Does armor interfere with the new ranger's <strong><em>animal empathy</em></strong> ability? What is that ability's range? Why don't druids have this ability?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A ranger can wear any type of armor and still use <strong><em>animal empathy</em></strong>. The ranger must be close enough to the animal to attract the animals undivided attention (about 10 yards in a wilderness setting less, if the setting is something like a crowded marketplace that provides distractions). Individual DMs may give druids <strong><em>animal empathy</em></strong> if they wish. The rules don't give the druid this ability because a druids focus is on nature as a whole, not just on animals.</span>
  </p>
  <p id="148-13">Sage Advice #148 (August 1989) p. 12, Question:13
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('148-13')" title="Copy to clipboard">📋</button>&ensp;<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DBFBlackbull/adnd-2e-sage-advice/blob/master/html/index.html
#148-13">🔗</a><br/><strong>Isn't the new ranger too limited in spells? Can a ranger pick more than one type of creature for an enemy?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The ranger's two spheres give him plenty of spells. However, individual DMs might want to add a sphere or two; one campaign I am familiar with allows rangers to use healing spells. The DM has to decide what constitutes a valid enemy. Since the rules mention giants, it is probably acceptable to choose a class of creatures. Thus, a ranger from the FORGOTTEN REALMS™ setting might be allowed to choose the goblin races (see <strong><em>Cyclopedia of the Realms</em></strong>, page 46) as an enemy. A ranger can never choose two or more entirely different creatures as enemies.</span>

#148-14">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can rangers wear elven chain mail and still use the special abilities described on page 28?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Elven chain mail interferes with a ranger's special abilities; refer to Table 29 (page 39) for a list of penalties. Elven chain mail also negates the ranger's ability to use two weapons without penalty.</span>
  </p>

#148-15">🔗</a><br/><strong>Does the ranger's + 4 attack bonus vs. a specific type of adversary apply to both attack and damage rolls?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The bonus applies only to attack rolls; see page 29.</span>
  </p>
  <p id="148-16">Sage Advice #148 (August 1989) p. 12, Question:16

#148-16">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can paladins become dual-classed characters?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;As clearly stated on page 44, there are no restrictions on the class combinations allowed to dual-classed characters, provided that alignment restrictions are respected. Most DMs, however, do not allow characters to combine subclasses (e.g., no bard/thieves, paladin/rangers, etc.).</span>

#148-17">🔗</a><br/><strong>With the large increase in the number of wizard spells, why wasn't there an increase in the minimum and maximum number of spells a wizard can learn? A wizard with an 18 intelligence can learn a maximum of 18 spells a level; that's less than half the number of first-level spells!</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The AD&D® game is one of choices. The additional spells are intended to create a greater variety of mage characters, not more powerful mages.</span>

#148-18">🔗</a><br/><strong>Table 22 (page 31) shows the minimum ability scores required for specialist wizards. What is the minimum intelligence score required for a specialist wizard?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Specialist wizards must have an intelligence score of at least 9, just like a normal wizard.</span>

#148-19">🔗</a><br/><strong>What happened to the write spell?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;It isn't needed anymore. The primary function of the write spell was to allow a mage to add a spell to his books after he had failed his chance to know roll for that spell. In the 2nd Edition game, a mage can attempt a new chance to know roll each time he gains a new level. (See "Spelling It Out," in DRAGON® issue #147, for more information.)</span>

#148-24">🔗</a><br/><strong>In Table 22 (page 31), the races allowed entry for diviners is any. Does this mean that a character of any PC race can be a diviner?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;No. Only races eligible for the mage class (humans, elves, and half elves) can become diviners.</span>

#148-25">🔗</a><br/><strong>What happened to cantrips?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Cantrips are still in the game. Just use the first-level <strong><em>cantrip</em></strong> spell. If you need help figuring out what kind of cantrips to cast, use your copy of <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong> as a guide. Actually, things are better now for cantrip-using mages because they no longer need to waste spell book space on cantrips, and they are no longer limited to the few cantrips in their books.</span>

#148-26">🔗</a><br/><strong>Since mages start the game with the ability to read spell books and to write in them, do they also have the ability to read and write their native languages?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;No. Magic is written in a special language.</span>
  </p>
  <p id="148-27">Sage Advice #148 (August 1989) p. 12, Question:27

#148-27">🔗</a><br/><strong>The new rules mention the possibility of <strong><em>fireballs</em></strong> detonating early and <strong><em>lightning bolts</em></strong> rebounding because of hitting an obstruction. My group and I thought these spells always hit, just as a <strong><em>magic missile</em></strong> spell does. If these spell do not always hit, how does the mage hit his opponent?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The spells do always hit, after a fashion. In the case of a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong>, the missile bursts at the designated range unless it strikes an object before it gets there. Since the missile flies in a straight line between the caster and the target, it can be blocked by invisible barriers (such as <strong><em>walls of force</em></strong>) or by a bend in a passage obscured by an illusion or mirror.<br>&emsp;A <strong><em>lightning bolt</em></strong> is similar to a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> in that the spell begins at a designated height and range, extending directly away from the caster. A <strong><em>lightning bolt</em></strong> is always either 40' or 80' long, and the caster must decide which when he casts the spell. If caster miscalculates and casts this spell into an area too small to contain it, the lightning bolt grows to its full length (as measured from the point where it strikes a barrier), heading back at the caster unless it smashes through the barrier (see page 151). Some readers have misread the example on page 151; <strong><em>lightning bolts</em></strong> do not bend or fold over when hitting a barrier. The 80' bolt in the example starts 40' away from the caster, travels 10', and strikes a barrier; the bolt must maintain its full length, however, so the opposite end of the bolt (starting from the point of origin) instantly grows out in the direction toward the spell-caster, extending 70' from its point of origin. Thus, the bolt's final length is SO'. A victim caught between the point of origin and the wall behind him is not struck twice by the bolt. The use of the word rebound in the spell's description seems to be the confusing element.</span>

#148-28">🔗</a><br/><strong>The text under the new <strong><em>identify</em></strong> spell says a fully charged <strong><em>ring of three wishes</em></strong> radiates only faint magic. Is this an error?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;There is no error in the spell's description, but you have made an erroneous statement. The <strong><em>identify</em></strong> spell does not detect magic or its strength; it reveals an item's functions and charges. A <strong><em>ring of three wishes</em></strong> has only three charges, so it is faintly charged. Smart wizards use a <strong><em>detect magic</em></strong> spell, which can determine magical strength and type, before casting <strong><em>identify</em></strong>.</span>

#149-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>Does a character need to spend two proficiencies in bastard sword use—one for one-handed use and one for two-handed use?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is up to the DM, but I suggest that two slots be required. One campaign I am familiar with allows characters with long sword or two-handed sword proficiency to use the bastard sword in its corresponding mode (in other words, a character who can use a long sword can use a bastard sword one-handed without penalty).</span>

#149-2">🔗</a><br/><strong>How can a sling bullet do the same damage as a heavy crossbow and more damage than a light or hand crossbow? Why would anyone bother with a crossbow when a sling has a better rate of fire, the same or better damage, a lower cost, and a lower weight?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Slings are very effective weapons and are often underrated. The bullets are heavy, have excellent aerodynamic qualities, and are hurled with a great deal of force. Why doesn't everybody use a sling? Well, try to swing a sling underwater, while hiding in dense undergrowth, or from around a corner. Also, bow and crossbow specialists get a point-blank range category and the ability to fire before the initiative roll in some cases.</span>

If so, what are resurrection survival scores used for?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is a typographical error. System shock rolls are made when characters are exposed to magical aging, polymorphing, or petrification. Resurrection survival rolls are used when bringing slain characters to life again.</span>

#149-5">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can characters use missile weapons when fighting toe-to-toe with an opponent?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Characters cannot aim and fire bows, use slings, or hurl hand-held weapons while in melee. Loaded and cocked crossbows can be fired in melee but cannot be reloaded.

Lassos and nets are not part of the 2nd Edition game and were mentioned in error. However, a typical war net is made from woven hemp cords and has small lead weights sewn into the edges. It is 5' across, weighs 6 lbs., and costs 12 sp. It takes two hands and 6' of clear space to throw a net, and the effective range is 30'. Any target hit by the net must save vs. breath weapon or become entangled. Entangled victims cannot fight or move, and defend at -2. Entangled victims wriggle free if they make a successful wrestling attack vs. AC 2; they can make one attempt to get free each round. When used as a melee weapon, treat a net as a scourge. A lasso is simply a rope with an adjustable loop. A successful hit with a lasso puts the loop around part of the target creature's body, but this does not necessarily immobilize the creature; the DM has to decide where the loop is (around the neck, a limb, the upper body, etc.) and assess the appropriate penalty. Since the lasso's wielder can pull the loop tight, the only way to escape, short of killing the wielder or getting the rope away from him, is to cut or break the rope.</span>

Falling damage is 1d6 for each 10' (or fraction of 10') fallen. The reasons are thoroughly explained on page 104. Individual DMs are free to plague their players with any variant falling damage systems they can devise.</span>

  <h2>Sage Advice #150, October 1989</h2>
  <h3>Combat and melee in the AD&D® 1st Edition game make up this month's topic, with special advice on fighting hydras. All references to the <strong><em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em></strong> and <strong><em>Players Handbook</em></strong> in this article are to the 1st Edition versions of those volumes. In all cases, the information in the AD&D 2nd Edition volumes takes precedence where there is a contradiction between those rules and this column.<br>&emsp;But first, a special word from the sage, then one from the editor.</h3>

Why don't you give a seminar at the GEN CON® game fair? If I come to Lake Geneva, can I meet you and ask you questions?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Although the "Sage Advice" in DRAGON issue #121 said the sage would make personal replies, I receive so many letters that I cannot answer every one. (However, if you don't enclose an SASE, I cannot reply at all.) Usually I reply only to letters that have questions I can use in the column, so that all the readers get the benefit of my time. Needless to say, I don't give extended private interviews in Lake Geneva or anywhere else.<br>&emsp;If you want to increase your chances of getting a personal reply, do the following:<br>&emsp;1. Look through your books for your answers, and be sure to consult the indexes (if the books have them). Often, with a little extra effort, you'll find rules that have eluded you.<br>&emsp;2. Keep your letter short. Decide what you really need to know, and stick to the most important questions. As I've stressed before, role-playing games involve choices and decisions; don't be afraid to make some on your own.<br>&emsp;3. Include the title of the book and the page number that contains the rule you are asking about; this saves me a lot of page flipping.<br>&emsp;My work with the RPGA™ Network keeps me busy at almost every game convention I attend, and seminars are not the best place to answer rules questions. I'm not an encyclopedia of game knowledge. I rely on a big library and a large network of personal contacts to find answers, and few people would be entertained by watching me flip through my books and consult my files while I struggle with a tricky question. Still, I do answer some questions at conventions; just keep them short, and don't interrupt me while I'm running a game. Also, some conventions I attend collect written questions for me so that I can use them in the column or work on them during the show and discuss the results with anyone who is interested.<br>&emsp;Skip Williams</span>

#150-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>What is the proper way to handle a fight with a hydra? Does the creature's effective hit dice drop as it loses heads? Will damage to the creature's body kill it? How do area-effect spells such as <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> effect the heads? How does one determine when a lernaean hydra's regeneration ability is stopped?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Hydras do pose a few problems, especially when magic is involved. I suggest the following rules for handling combat with a hydra.<br>&emsp;A hydra's effective hit dice do not drop as the creature loses heads. With respect to melee, each of a hydra's heads is treated as a separate creature. Each head dies when it reaches zero hit points, and excess damage does not carry over to another head. When all heads are reduced to zero hit points, the creature dies immediately. Hits to a hydra's body will kill it; the body has as many hit points as the total hit points of its starting heads. When the body is reduced to zero hit points, however, the creature continues to fight as long as it has at least one living head. It will then fight for an additional 2-8 rounds or until the body is reduced to -20 hp.<br>&emsp;A lernaean hydra's regeneration ability makes it a tougher nut to crack. The individual heads can be slain in the normal manner; however, a fire source must be applied to each slain head or it will regenerate. <strong><em>Burning hands</em></strong> is the easiest way to scorch the stumps or sundered heads. A torch, flask of oil,. or <strong><em>flame tongue</em></strong> sword will stop a single head's regeneration if applied in time. Any successful hit on the slain head will stop regeneration. A lernaean hydra stays alive as long as it has one living or regenerating head (hits to the creature's body not withstanding).<br>&emsp;When any hydra is affected by an area spell such as <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> or <strong><em>lightning bolt</em></strong>, the heads are treated as a single entities, with the damage distributed as evenly as possible among the heads. Although the heads are separate melee targets, they are still part of the same creature. The creature's body suffers as much damage as the heads took in total (i.e., the hydra gets one saving throw, but the heads and the body each take damage).<br>&emsp;Spells that can kill a creature outright such as <strong><em>death spell</em></strong>, <strong><em>power word kill</em></strong>, or <strong><em>disintegrate</em></strong> kill the creature only if it fails its saving throw (if applicable). When determining a hydra's resistance to such spells, its effective hit dice are equal to its starting number of heads (or peak number, in the case of a lernaean hydra), and its effective hit points are equal to the total hit points of all the heads (damage to the body notwithstanding).<br>&emsp;A spell that affects one creature or a limited area (such as <strong><em>magic missile</em></strong> or <strong><em>burning hands</em></strong>) must be directed either at the body or at one or more heads of the hydra, according to the limitations of the spell. Spells such as <strong><em>charm monster</em></strong>, <strong><em>hold monster</em></strong>; or <strong><em>slow</em></strong> affect the entire creature, as the beast effectively has only one brain—perhaps at the base of the necks inside the body.</span>

#150-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>What happens if a magic-user uses a sword when in desperate need?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;If a character's need is truly great, the DM can allow any class of character to use a weapon prohibited to his class. The normal nonproficiency penalty applies (perhaps with an additional - 1 to hit). If a player falls into the habit of declaring his characters in desperate need too often, however, the DM should either disallow the use of the prohibited weapon or give the character no experience award for completing the adventure.</span>

#150-5">🔗</a><br/><strong>What are the effects of blindness and deafness on spell-casting?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Blinded creatures are unable to cast any spell that requires a target, but spells that can be cast on an area (such as <strong><em>fireball</em></strong>) or delivered by touch (such as <strong><em>cure light wounds</em></strong>) may still be used. Deafness can cause spells with verbal components to be miscast and fail. The failure chance is up to you, but it shouldn't exceed 20% (less for spells with short casting times). The cleric spell <strong><em>holy word</em></strong> has a deafness effect that causes spells to fail 50% of the time; this is due mostly to the extreme power of the holy word, not merely the deafness.</span>

#150-6">🔗</a><br/><strong>What is the significance of weapon speed factors?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Weapon speed factors allow for comparison among weapons. The lower the speed factor, the quicker the weapon. Their most common use (and the only use mentioned in the rules) is for breaking ties on initiative. When a tie occurs, compare weapon speed factors; the lowest factor goes first. However, on the first round of a melee, when the opponents are closing, the longer weapons have the advantage. The advantage is also with mounted opponents attacking or defending against unmounted opponents and with characters who are defending or attacking from above. Spellcasting time is equivalent to the weapon speed factor. That is, a weapon with a speed factor of 3 is as slow as a three- segment spell for purposes of tie breaking.</span>

#150-7">🔗</a><br/><strong>How do you use the weapon to-hit adjustment tables in the <strong><em>Players Handbook</em></strong> (page 38) and <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong> (page 27)? I don't understand what they mean.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The tables list the bonus or penalty given to a weapon against the basic armor types. For example, the line for Axe, Hand reads: -5, -4, -3, etc., for AC 0, AC 1, AC 2, etc., respectively. Full plate armor and shield gives AC 0, so a hand axe has a -5 to hit vs. full plate armor and shield. If the target were wearing full plate armor + 1 and using no shield, the adjustment is still AC 0. However, full plate armor alone is AC 1, so you use the AC 1 column regardless of magical bonuses, and the hand axe has a -4 to hit. The same holds true for dexterity bonuses. These tables are for attacking humans, demi-humans, and humanoids—never for attacking monsters. Use of the tables is strictly optional; they were included in the game mainly to satisfy the real history buffs who know that certain weapons were much more effective than others on the medieval battlefield.</span>

#150-11">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a character with a <strong><em>girdle of giant strength</em></strong> throw a halberd? When one of my players tried to do this I allowed it, but with a big to-hit penalty.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;You were correct. Pole arms are not intended to be thrown, no matter what the thrower's strength. Anything, however, can be thrown with some chance of success. For throwing a pole arm, we suggest a to-hit penalty of -4 at short range (10' or less), -6 at medium range (11-20'), and -9 at long range (21-30'). We also suggest that you use these ranges outdoors where other missiles have ranges measured in yards. A pole arm is far too long for a human-sized creature to throw like a hand axe (so that the weapon spins or tumbles), no matter how much strength is available. Spear-type throws are possible, but hits can inflict damage only if the pole arm that is thrown has a spear point. Use spear damage (1-6) in this case, not pole-arm damage.</span>

Space requirements are cumulative; therefore, two fighters using battle axes side-by-side would require 8' of space.</span>

#150-18">🔗</a><br/><strong>How long does paralyzation last? Is it permanent until cured? What cures paralyzation? What is paralyzation, really?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;In medical terms, paralyzation is the loss of sensation in part of the body as the victim's brain, for one reason or another, no longer controls the body. The uncontrolled muscles relax, and the victim goes limp. Autonomic muscles, such as the heart and lungs, are unaffected. Some kinds of paralysis in the AD&D game (paralysis caused by ghouls and ghasts, for example) cause the victim to become rigid and immobile. In either case, paralysis affects only the body, not the mind. The victim can still think and use psionics or any form of movement that does not require muscular effort. For example, if a character becomes paralyzed while using a <strong><em>fly</em></strong> spell, he can still fly until the spell runs out.<br>&emsp;Paralyzation is not permanent. It can last anywhere from several rounds or turns to as much as a day. It can be removed with a <strong><em>remove paralysis</em></strong> spell (which removes paralysis of all types) or by a <strong><em>cure disease</em></strong>, <strong><em>neutralize poison</em></strong>, or <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> spell, depending on what caused the paralysis. Paralysis caused by undead creatures is disease- or fear-based; paralysis caused by living creatures is poison-based; paralysis caused by a <strong><em>glyph of warding</em></strong> or the illusionist spell <strong><em>paralyzation</em></strong> is magic-based. The AD&D 2nd Edition <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong>, Volume 1, lists the duration for ghoul paralysis as 3-8 rounds and ghast paralysis as 5-10 rounds. Paralysis caused by more powerful creatures lasts longer; lich paralysis, for example, lasts until dispelled.</span>

#150-24">🔗</a><br/><strong>How do high dexterity scores or a <strong><em>short sword of quickness</em></strong> affect initiative?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;High dexterity never affects initiative; it affects only surprise. A <strong><em>short sword of quickness</em></strong> allows the wielder to attack first. This is not the same has having the initiative; a thief-acrobat (for example) cannot automatically evade each round simply because he has a <strong><em>short sword of quickness</em></strong>. He must win the die roll before he can evade.</span>

#150-26">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a character fire a missile into a melee without hitting friendly characters? If not, what is the chance of hitting an ally?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This depends on the situation. When firing into a melee, use the following procedure:<br>&emsp;The character firing the missile declares which creature he is targeting. (Any of the character's allies who are fighting with the target creatures are potential targets for the missile.) Randomly determine which target will actually be in the path of the missile. If the figures in the melee are about the same size (e.g., human vs. hu- man, elf vs. dwarf), there is an equal chance that either the enemy or an ally could be the missile's actual target. If the die roll indicates that an ally will be the actual target and there are multiple allies fighting the intended target, randomly determine which ally is the actual target.<br>&emsp;Roll the to-hit number. If the appropriate number for the target's armor class is rolled, then the target is hit whether or not the character firing the missile wanted to hit that target. If the creatures in the melee are of different sizes, the larger creatures are more likely to be hit. I sug- gest a two-thirds chance (1-4 on 1d61 to hit the larger target when the height difference is 2-3' (ignore height differences of less than 2'). If the height difference is more than 3', allow the missile to hit the larger target automatically if the firer wishes; otherwise, the chance to hit the larger target is 5 in 6.<br>&emsp;Many campaigns exempt the <strong><em>magic missiles</em></strong> spell from this rule. <strong><em>Magic missiles</em></strong> are assumed to unerringly strike their targets.</span>

If the creature is unintelligent, this will be a random opponent. Intelligent creatures may pick their victims. Any opponent who can see the creature can be subject to the attack. The opponent who is subjected to the gaze attack must save vs. petrification. Some campaigns allow opponents to avert their eyes and become immune to the gaze attack, but such opponents attack and defend at a -4 penalty, and the decision to avert the eyes must be made prior to both the initiative roll and anyone knowing where the gaze will be directed. Some DMs may rule that if an entire party is surprised, all must save against the gaze during the first surprise segment of the encounter (several party members could accidentally meet the creature's gaze during the confusion of the surprise segment).</span>

A torch may be used as a secondary weapon if the DM thinks the situation warrants it. Apply the "Attacks With Two Weapons" rule on page 70 of the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>. If players attempt to abuse the privilege, the DM might have a character set fire to himself or his equipment. Have the torch either save vs. normal blow as thin wood, or break.

#150-36">🔗</a><br/><strong>How long does it take to draw a weapon?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Any weapon can be drawn in one segment (this effectively adds one segment to the weapon's speed factor). Common sense, however, dictates that a character who draws a weapon during a melee will lose initiative to a character who has already drawn his weapon, unless the character with the drawn weapon must use the segment that is required for the draw in order to close to melee range. Note that sheathing a weapon takes a bit longer; changing weapons carefully takes a full round (see <strong><em>Oriental Adventures</em></strong>, page 54).</span>

A one-minute melee round certainly allows time for several attacks, especially if the character uses a light weapon such as a dagger.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A single melee attack in the AD&D game <strong>assumes</strong> the exchange of several blows. The player's single attack roll represents the result of a series of attacks by the character, not just a Single blow. See the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 61, for more details. High-level characters who are allowed multiple attacks do not actually strike more blows; their greater experience merely allows them to strike a larger percentage of <strong><em>telling</em></strong> blows.</span>

Since there are no hit location tables in the AD&D game, how do you determine if the sap hit the opponent's head?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> has a rule that says an intelligent creature can aim a blow at an opponent's head half the time (1-3 on 1d6). While this rule (see page 46) encourages characters to wear helmets, I think it's a bit excessive. Try any of the following for adjudicating attacks with a sap:<br>&emsp;Any attack roll four or more over the minimum score needed to hit the target strikes the head. Strength bonuses don't count when determining the minimum score to hit, but bonuses for rear attacks (including a thief's back-attack bonus) and attacks on prone opponents do count.<br>&emsp;Treat the sap as a pummeling implement, and use the rules on page 107 of <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong>. The sap does no damage unless a stun is scored. It has the chance of a large and hard object to stun, and does normal sap damage (1-2) when a stun is scored. A sap is a weapon and negates the initiative penalty for pummeling attacks. Roll a 1d6 before each attack; a one indicates that the attack will strike the head if the sap hits.</span>

It is true that battle axes were often used with two hands, but this was because a man without a shield did not have anything better to do with his free hand and the axe's long haft provided space for the additional grip. If you want to experiment with statistics for two-handed use, improve the speed factor and AC adjustment for all armor types by + 1 and increase the damage inflicted to 3-9 (2d4 + 1). Weight, length, and space required are unchanged. The improvements reflect the extra muscle the wielder gains from using two hands.</span>

Where did the extra time go?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The Kara-Tur calendar is 356 days long, making it nine days short when compared with the calendar of the FORGOTTEN REALMS™ setting on the very same planet. "Just Making Time," an article in DRAGON® issue #123, provides a quick solution for this problem. A nine-day festival is held between the consecutive months of Tu and Tsou, belonging to no month, which can be extended for one day every four years by imperial decree (accounting for leap years). The Kara-Tur zodiac has a celestial space unclaimed by any other constellation, matching this gap in the calendar.</span>

Gold, electrum, and platinum are not accepted as currency in Kara-Tur, so these coins must be sold for the market value of the metal in them. The market value of one gold piece is 2-7 (1d6 + 1) tael (see page 38). Extrapolating, a platinum piece is worth 11-30 (1d20 + 20) tael. The market price of gold and platinum varies independently, so it is possible for the price of platinum to be low while the price of gold is high.

The DM has to decide what sages can do in his campaign, but giving a sage a chance to determine an item's exact pluses is reasonable. Sages have no way to determine charges; a wand with one charge looks exactly like a wand with 99 charges. If the item was first studied with <strong><em>detect magic</em></strong> and <strong><em>identify</em></strong> spells, a sage could study the item for additional clues about who made and enchanted it and stand a good chance of guessing its powers.

This is because the designers and editors believe (and I agree) that the AD&D game system begins to break down around level 20. After level 20, continued advancement becomes almost meaningless, adventures are hard to design, and campaigns are hard to maintain.

#153-6">🔗</a><br/><strong>How do blindness (such as from <strong><em>cause blindness</em></strong>) and deafness each affect spell-casting?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Blinded creatures are unable to cast any spell that requires a visible target (such as <strong><em>magic missile</em></strong>). Spells that can be cast on an area (such as <strong><em>fireball</em></strong>) or delivered by touch (such as <strong><em>cure light wounds</em></strong>) are still usable.<br>&emsp;Deafness can cause spells with verbal components to be miscast and fail. The failure chance is up to the DM, but it shouldn't exceed 20% (less for spells with short casting times). A 2% cumulative failure chance per segment of spell-casting is suggested. The spell <strong><em>holy word</em></strong> has a deafening effect that causes spells to fail 50% of the time. This is due mostly to the extreme power of the <strong><em>holy word</em></strong>, not merely the condition of deafness.</span>

Note, however, that all equipment carried <strong><em>polymorphs</em></strong> with the caster, so spell components won't always be available.

#154-10">🔗</a><br/><strong>When a <strong><em>Mordenkainen's disjunction</em></strong> spell is cast, how do you determine the effects on magical items? Will an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> or <strong><em>wall of force</em></strong> keep the effects of the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong> out? What if only part of a spell's area of effect overlaps the area of the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong>?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Items in the possession of the spellcaster are immune to the spell's effects. Items in the possession of other creatures gain their possessors' saving throws vs. spells, with all adjustments. Items that are by themselves can be <strong><em>disjoined</em></strong> using the <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> spell's system (comparing the caster's level vs. the level at which the magical item was created). Potions and scrolls are treated as if created by 8th-level magic-users; permanent magical items are treated as if created by 12th-level magic-users.<br>&emsp;If any portion of a spell's area of effect overlaps the area of the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong>, the entire spell is <strong><em>disjoined</em></strong>. A <strong><em>wall of force</em></strong> can be so <strong><em>disjoined</em></strong>, and it will have no effect on the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong> spell. Treat the chance for <strong><em>disjoining</em></strong> an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> as that for an artifact, but with no chance for attracting the attention of a powerful being (see <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong>, page 65). If an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> is unaffected, it protects all magic within its area; if the <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> is <strong><em>disjoined</em></strong>, all magical spells, effects, and items within the area of the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong> are subject to its effects.</span>

#154-11">🔗</a><br/><strong>How do you determine the effect of a <strong><em>sleep</em></strong> spell on a group of mixed creature types?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is up to the DM. He may rule that weaker creatures are affected first, or he may allow the caster to choose whether the more powerful creatures or the weaker creatures are affected first. He may also rule that creatures closest to the center of the spell's area of effect are affected first. The DM can choose any of these methods as long as he uses the same method all of the time.<br>&emsp;If weaker creatures are affected first, the DM should roll to see how many of them are put to sleep and apply the effects. If all of the weaker creatures were put to sleep by the spell, and if the number of potential victims rolled was greater than the number actually affected, the DM may then take half of that difference (dropping fractions) and apply that to the next most powerful group of victims. For example, a magic-user faces a group of six 1—1-HD creatures, two 1-HD creatures, and one 3-HD creature. The DM rolls 4d4 and gets a 10. The six 1—1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving a difference of 4. Half of 4 is two, so the two 1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving the 3-HD creature unaffected., In another example, the magic-user faces four 1-HD creatures and one 4 + 1-HD creature. The DM rolls 2d4 and gets a 5. Four 1-HD creatures fall asleep; the difference is 1, but nothing remains after 1 is reduced by half and all fractions are dropped. Even if the result of the 2d4 roll had been an 8, the 4 + 1-HD creature would not be affected (8 - 4 = 4, 1⁄2 x 4 = 2, but no monsters were present in the 2 + 1 to 3-HD category). The PC should not have everything his own way!</span>

#154-12">🔗</a><br/><strong>How does an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> work? Does it destroy any spell with which it comes in contact? Can the caster cast spells through the <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong>?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;An <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> negates all magic within its area of effect. The caster's spells (which originate within the shell) are also negated, although they may remain after the shell's duration expires if their own durations are long enough. Note also that the shell causes magical items within its area of effect to cease functioning. In any case, the shell does not function like a <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> spell. Magical items are not destroyed by the shell; they merely cease to function while within it. If their duration permits, magical effects will still function when they are taken away from the shell or when the shell's duration expires. For example, a <strong><em>continual light</em></strong> spell cast upon a rock will be negated only as long as that rock is within the shell; the <strong><em>continual light</em></strong> spell functions normally afterward. If part of a magical effect's area extends into the shell, only the portion within the shell is negated; the effect functions normally outside the shell. However, if a spell with an instantaneous duration is cast so that its center is within the radius of the shell, the spell is <em>completely</em> negated. For example, if a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> were cast so that it would detonate inside an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong>, there would be no effect. If a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> were cast so that it would detonate outside the <strong><em>shell</em></strong>, however, only the portion of the <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> crossing into the shell would be negated.</span>

A spell that is capable of producing Hades or Hastur is a bit unfair.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;It is unlikely that Hades or Hastur will be conjured by a <strong><em>weird</em></strong> spell, as deities of this power are almost never the personal nemeses of mere mortals. (Of course, if the spell were cast at a deity-class creature, it might produce such opponents.) If the spell is cast against an orc, it's likely to produce a hobgoblin or a gnoll at most. It is up to the DM to adjudicate any use of this spell reasonably and fairly (see <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong>, page 71).</span>

When does the magic-user add spells to his book?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;For a beginning character, ignore the minimum number of spells on Intelligence Table II in the PHB (page 10). A 1st-level magic-user has a book of four spells, as per the DMG, page 39. He does not roll his "chance to know" for these spells.<br>&emsp;As the magic-user gains levels, he gains new spells as part of his training. It is best to simply give the magic-user a new spell for his book each time he gains the ability to cast an additional spell. For example, a 1st-level magic-user can cast one first-level spell. When the magic-user reaches 2nd level, he can cast two first-level spells, and he gains an additional first-level spell for his book. His intelligence still determines the maximum number of spells of each level he can have in his book, and his chance of successfully writing any given spell into his book.<br>&emsp;The DM should select the new spell, and the magic-user must successfully make his "chance to know" roll in order to gain it. If the roll fails, the DM should assign an- other spell. To allow magic-user PCs more options when choosing spells, you might give each such PC an extra 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th-level spell when the magic-user first gains the ability to cast it (this will occur at 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, respectively).<br>&emsp;The magic-user can also try to add spells to his book when he finds them on scrolls or in captured spell books. The magic-user rolls his "chance to know" and, if successful, may add the spell to his book. The spell disappears from the scroll or book when the magic-user adds it to his book.<br>&emsp;If, during the course of play, the magic-user has tried every spell of a given level but has fewer spells of that level than the minimum for his intelligence score, he can go back and try to learn one or more spells a second time.<br>&emsp;For more information, see "Spelling It Out," in DRAGON issue #147.</span>

#154-24">🔗</a><br/><strong>Do spells end when their casters are killed?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is up to the DM. There are two schools of thought here. One holds that a spell is a discrete, independent event involving a fixed amount of magical energy. Once the event begins, it runs like clockwork; only anti-magic in some form (<strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong>, <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong>, etc.) will keep it from running its full course. The other school holds that the caster must be alive to act as a channel for the energy the spell requires. No matter which school you follow, there will be some exceptions. For example, any spell requiring concentration from the caster will end if the caster dies. Spells that are permanent will remain after the caster dies.</span>

The spell "on hands" is discharged when the caster next touches someone or something. Some DMs rule that the spell remains only as long as the caster concentrates on touching a recipient—the spell is lost if the caster abandons the touch at- tempt for any reason.</span>

#155-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>After purchasing the first two volumes of the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong>, I cannot help but have the sneaking suspicion that devils and demons are not going to appear in any of the new monster tomes. I, for one, would be disappointed if these most villainous of villains are to be excluded from the AD&D game. In short, are devils and demons going to appear in any AD&D 2nd Edition reference books, or has society reared its ugly head once more to thwart creativity and enjoyment?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The answer, in short, is at present there are no plans to include devils, demons, and similar creatures in the AD&D 2nd Edition game. Society has not reared its "ugly head." In fact, society is the source of creativity and enjoyment—gamers, game producers, and game columnists are part of society. Society as a whole is not down on gamers; some people I know who make it a hobby to study the anti-role-playing movement tell me the whole brouhaha is the work of less than a dozen people, most of them in the United States, who were well known for their questionable religious dogmas long before the D&D® and AD&D games came on the scene. No major religious sect or denomination officially opposes the D&D game or any other role-playing game. These few individuals have been able to fool a lot of people into believing their propaganda by pointing to a few items in the old AD&D game books and saying, "This is a satanic game." The unsuspecting public, being uninformed about role-playing and disinclined to actually read the books themselves, started buying this vituperation.<br>&emsp;The demons and devils in the old <strong><em>Monster Manuals</em></strong> were a prime weapon in the campaign of misinformation directed against gaming, so they were dropped from the new edition. It's possible that demons and devils will be revised into a format that preserves their usefulness in adventure design and does not give the game's detractors cheap ammunition, but that format hasn't been found yet. In the meantime, the revamped dragons and giants—which have been given a tremendous boost in the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong>—should do a nice job of filling the role of ultimate adversary.</span>

If so, how can a really big dragon ever miss? How much damage do black dragons really do with their breath weapons? What does the "MT" column mean on the black dragon's statistics table? Why are separate body and tail lengths given for each dragon type? What is the correct tail length entry for great wyrm bronze dragons? How many times can a dragon use its breath weapon each day? The text on dragons seems to imply that dragons have no limit on how often they can use breath weapons, but the dragon turtle's description strongly implies that the limit is three times per day.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A dragon's combat modifier applies only to its damage rolls; the reference to attack rolls is left over from an earlier version of the manuscript. From age category five on, one digit has been dropped from the black dragon's breath weapon rating; starting from age category one, the column should read: 2d4+1, 4d4+2, 6d4+3, 8d4+4, 10d4+5, 12d4+6, 14d4+7, 16d4+8, 18d4+9, 20d4+10, 22d4+11, and 24d4+12. The "MT" is a typo; it should read "MR" for magic resistance. Only a dragon's body length is considered when calculating a dragon's size rating, since the tail is very thin. Also, damage to a dragon's tail does not really harm the dragon; only hits on the body and wings are telling enough to reduce the dragon's hit points. This makes dragons a little less vulnerable to mob tactics. A great wyrm bronze dragon's tail is 100-110' long. In the core AD&D 2nd Edition rules, a dragon can use its breath weapon three times a day, once every three rounds. To make fighting dragons less of a certain thing, however, I suggest you make the interval between breath weapons variable (roll 1d3 for the number of interval rounds). An alternate method for determining the number of a dragon's breath weapons used each day is discussed in "The New Ecology of the Dragons," in DRAGON issue #146.</span>

Ultimately, the winning argument had two points. First, dragon breath is not magical fire; the flame produced inside a dragon is not the same as the fire in a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> or <strong><em>wall of fire</em></strong> spell. Second, making fire giants immune to fire would imbalance the game because so many attack spells are based on fire. Still, there are plenty of nonfiery attack spells, so your campaign isn't likely to suffer if you decide to make your fire giants completely fire resistant.</span>

Since it is impractical to reprint most of volume 2 to get the correctly spelled "huecuva" in proper alphabetical order, the creature has been officially renamed. Heucuva (the name is the same in singular and plural forms) appear to be common skeletons when viewed with infravision, no matter what guise they have adopted using <strong><em>polymorph</em></strong>; a party using infravision will simply not be able to distinguish them from regular skeletons. Note that torch or lantern light, which is necessary for making maps, spoils infravision and keeps all characters with infravision from seeing a heucuva's skeletal form. (The shadow cast by a <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> heucuva will be that of the shape it has assumed, not that of a skeleton.)</span>

#155-27">🔗</a><br/><strong>I understand that a magic-user can cast only the spells in his book, but how often can a spell in a book be cast? A friend told me that a 1st-level magic-user can cast only one spell per day, but the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> says that a 1st-level magic-user has a book of four spells.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;You seem to be confused by the difference between the number of spells a magic-user can have memorized at any given time and the number of spells that he can have written in his spell book.<br>&emsp;The number of spells that any magic-user can have memorized at any one time is given on the Spells Usable By Class And Level chart in the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong> (page 26). To use the chart, find the level of the spell-caster (first column). The total number of spells his brain can hold is given to the right of his level. For example, the "Magic-users Spell Level" line for a 4th-level magic-user reads: 3 2. This means that a 4th-level magic-user can memorize up to three first-level spells and two second-level spells.<br>&emsp;When a magic-user prepares for an adventure, he studies his books and commits spells to memory, up to his "full load." When he casts one of these spells, the memory of it goes away (as explained on page 40 of the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>), and he must memorize it again before he can cast it again. The number of spells a magic-user can have in his spell book is determined by his intelligence score.<br>&emsp;There are two ways, however, that the magic-user could cast a spell without memorizing it first. The first is by using a scroll—a temporary magical writing. Any time after a magic-user has studied a scroll while using a <strong><em>read magic</em></strong> spell, he can read that scroll aloud and cast the spell written on it, whether or not he has that spell memorized. A spell written on a scroll can be cast once only; the writing disappears when the spell is cast. (See pages 100-101 of the 1st Edition <strong><em>PHB</em></strong> and pages 127-128 of the 1st Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> for more information on the use of scrolls.) The second is to read the spell directly out of the spell book. This causes the spell to disappear from the book (so that the magic-user cannot memorize it again until he can write it into the book again) and may also cause other spells to disappear from the book (see page 80 of <strong><em>Unearthed Arcana</em></strong> for more details on casting spells directly from books).</span>

(Artifacts function, but any spell-like effects they produce are suppressed.) Both effects work normally, even in the area of overlap.</span>

Who is right?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Watery ranger:</strong> I have my doubts about the validity of the wish. Since it was used against a character directly, I'd treat it as a permanent <strong><em>polymorph any object</em></strong> spell. Such a wish could be dispelled so long as the water-character stayed intact. Once the water is spilled, evaporated, or consumed, the character's "essence" is scattered or destroyed, and only another <strong><em>wish</em></strong> will restore the character.</span>

How about <strong><em>animating</em></strong> the corpse, then <strong><em>enlarging</em></strong> it and making it permanent—would the caster of the <strong><em>permanency</em></strong> spell lose a constitution point then?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Enlarged corpse:</strong> A corpse is an object. Use the rules for non-living objects when adjudicating the results of <strong><em>enlarge</em></strong> or <strong><em>permanency</em></strong> spells. A zombie, however, is a creature (even if it is biologically dead). In the AD&D® 1st Edition rules, a mage who <strong><em>enlarged</em></strong> a corpse and cast <strong><em>permanency</em></strong> on it would have only a 5% chance to lose point of constitution (see the 1st Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 46), because he was working with an object. The AD&D 2nd Edition game does not make a distinction between permanent effects on objects or creatures, but I think it's safe to assume this is an oversight. In either game, the <strong><em>enlarged</em></strong> corpse could be animated as a huge, 1-HD zombie.</span>

#156-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>How far can three bozak draconians (which are described in the <strong><em>DRAGONLANCE® Adventures</em></strong> book) be hurled from a catapult if they were bound together and had their wings amputated? What would be the range if they were launched singly? Would the ranges for other draconians be similar?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Catapulted draconians:</strong> Light catapults hurl rocks that weigh 8-10 lbs. Heavy catapults hurl rocks that weigh 20-25 lbs. Even a single draconian of any species placed on a catapult would overload the machine so much that the catapult wouldn't fire at all. Trebuchets, however, have a much larger load capacity, hurling rocks that weigh about 500 lbs., which is probably about right for three draconians. Rocks, however, are a bit more aerodynamic than any three wingless draconians tied together, so a draconian-firing trebuchet's range should be halved, for a maxi- mum range of 240 yards and a minimum of 120 yards.<br>&emsp;A single draconian fired from a trebuchet is grossly underweight as well as unaerodynamic, producing an effect akin to trying to hurl a slightly underinflated beach ball. Use the scatter diagram on page 63 of the 2nd Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>. Treat the point labeled "intended target" as the trebuchet; a roll of 1 indicates that the draconian is hurled straight up into the air and lands right on the trebuchet (or on top of its operators, at the DM's option). Any other roll indicates that the draconian flies wildly off in the given direction. Roll 8d4 × 10 for the total distance in yards that the draconian "flies."</span>

Wouldn't the two characters be identical and friendly toward each other (not prone to kill each other as two clones would)?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Wormy PC:</strong> Characters retain their hit points and intellect when subjected to <strong><em>polymorphing</em></strong>, so your character should have been the worlds smartest and toughest worm, at least until he failed an intelligence check and assumed a worm's mentality (if a worm can be said to have a mentality). Your character would be dead if chopped in half while still mentally a "person" If the character reverted to worm mentality before being cut in half, it still would be one tough worm (having your PC's hit points), but it might very well survive being chopped in half if anyone were persistent enough to actually do it. Many DMs, however, would rule that the <strong><em>polymorph</em></strong> spell could no longer be dispelled once the change in personality took place. If the magic on either or both halves of the worm were dispelled, you'd have one or two halves of a dead character. Each "new" worm still is only half a character, even if allowed to grow into a whole worm.</span>

Could the paladin or my character engage in melee using this arrangement? How much would a legless gnome weigh?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Legless gnome:</strong> The character carrying the gnome is going to be encumbered, even if he can handle the weight, because of the gnome's bulk. This means he'll suffer at least a -1 penalty to his to-hit rolls (see the 2nd Edition <strong><em>Player's Handbook</em></strong>, page 79); the penalty will be worse if the gnome weighs enough to reduce the carrier's movement. The DM might also add an initiative penalty equal to the combat penalty. The gnome could fight if his arms were free. I suggest a -4 penalty to his to-hit roll and a +3 penalty to his initiative.<br>&emsp;Human, elf, half-elf, and halfling anatomy generally follows the so-called Rule of Nines: The head takes up 9% of the body's weight, each arm 9%, the chest 18%, the abdomen 18%, and each leg 18%. The missing 1% is ignored. Gnomes and dwarves are stocky and carry less mass in their limbs. The distribution of their weight might be: head 9%; each arm 8%, chest 21%, abdomen 21%, and each leg 16%.</span>

#156-7">🔗</a><br/><strong>If a <strong><em>bastard sword +6</em></strong>, defender was trampled by a triceratops, and the roll on the item saving-throw table was a 1 on 1d20, would the item fail because the roll was a 1 or would it make the save because it needs a 6 to save and its pluses make up the difference? If the sword did break, could it be remade with all its pluses? Would a <strong><em>wish</em></strong> completely restore the broken sword?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Dinosaur vs. magical item:</strong> In either edition of the AD&D game, a roll of 1 always fails a saving throw, weapons' bonuses notwithstanding. Someone is bound to write to me and point out that the item saving-throw table in the 1st Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 80, lists the numbers 1 and 0 in several places. When an item has a saving throw of 1, a roll of 1 still fails; however, if the DM assigns a circumstantial penalty, any adjusted roll of 1 or more is a successful save. For example, a book falling 15' onto a hard surface has a modifier of -2 (-1 for every 5' beyond the first 5'1; if a 3 were rolled as a save, the save would be successful (3 - 2 = 1, still good). Items that have a save of 0 are immune to the listed attack form; for example, liquids are immune to blows, even if their containers are not.<br>&emsp;A <strong><em>wish</em></strong> certainly could restore the sword if all its pieces were present. Whether or not the sword could simply be remade is up to the DM. I suggest that most enchanted items be rendered nonmagical if broken, though I can think of one or two classic fantasy stories in which broken magical items were remade. If the item is very powerful (with a bonus of +4 or better), it might be remade if it is simply broken—not <strong><em>disintegrated</em></strong> or reduced to ash or slag—and if it rolls a second save of 20. The item should get a bonus of +1 for every two magical bonuses the item has (artifacts receive a +4 bonus to their saves). If the item fails the second save, it no longer radiates magic; characters smart enough to use <strong><em>detect magic</em></strong> will know an attempt to repair the item is a waste of time. If the save is successful, the repair should be made using the best possible materials and a master craftsman of unequaled skill; finding either of these should be an adventure in itself. If the DM really wants to prolong the player's agony, he can require the being who will repair the item to make a successful proficiency check and maybe even make a save vs. spells to be successful.</span>

#156-8">🔗</a><br/><strong>The rules say a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> detonates at a point designated by the caster or when it strikes a solid object. What is the chance of an archer hitting the <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> with an arrow and causing it to detonate while in flight?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong>Shooting down a <em>fireball</em>:</strong> I repeated this question to one of my regular playing groups and got in return five bemused grins and the following straight-faced comment: "Gee, you'll also need rules for [shooting down <strong><em>fireballs</em></strong> with] <strong><em>magic missiles</em></strong> and things like that, too." For the record, hitting a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> or similar missile with another missile, magical or not, is about as likely as every creature on a world taking a step at the same instant, thereby creating cataclysmic vibrations that shake the planet apart.

#156-9">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a <strong><em>ring of regeneration</em></strong> restore a female character's maidenhood? Could this be done well enough to fool a unicorn?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong> <em>Regenerating</em> maidenhood:</strong> Sorry, unicorns know their maidens too well to be fooled. Under certain circumstances, a <strong><em>ring of regeneration</em></strong> can restore the—ahem—physical aspects of a lady's maidenhood. A <strong><em>ring of regeneration</em></strong> can restore any damage or appendage loss if it occurs while the ring is worn. For example, if a character wearing a <strong><em>ring of regeneration</em></strong> loses a finger, the ring will eventually restore the finger. However, if the character loses the finger and then dons the ring, the finger isn't regrown. In a similar vein, a <strong><em>ring of regeneration</em></strong> can't be passed from character to character to provide a party with cheap healing. Damage that exists before the ring is put on is not restored. Note that a clerical <strong><em>regenerate</em></strong> spell can restore a lost limb at any time. In any case, maidenhood is a state of being. Once it is lost, it is lost forever, <strong><em>regeneration</em></strong> notwithstanding.</span>

#156-10">🔗</a><br/><strong>In DRAGON issue #148, you said elven chain mail negates a ranger's ability to fight two-handed without penalty. Why is this? Armor made from elven steel has one-half the normal encumbrance value, according to the 2nd Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>. So elven chain mail weighs 20 lbs., or 5 lbs. less than studded leather, which is the "heaviest" armor a ranger can wear and still avoid the penalty.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Chain mail armor isn't all metal. Chain mail is a shirt of metal links worn over a padded garment; this is necessary to keep the links from being driven into the wearer's body when a blow strikes. The padding weighs about 10 lbs., giving elven chain mail a weight of 25 lbs., the same as studded leather. Second, weight alone is not the only factor. The armor's thickness, stiffness, weight distribution, and general protective value also must be considered. While elven chain mail weighs about as much as studded leather, it is still "heavier." Generally, any armor type whose base armor class (before magical or dexterity adjustments) is AC 6 or better is "heavier" than studded leather, even if it actually weighs less than 25 lbs. due to materials or enchantments, or both.</span>

However, enchanted monsters are those brought into being with conjuration/ summoning spells, and <strong><em>animate dead</em></strong> is necromantic. Ghouls are hedged out because their descriptions in the 1st Edition <strong><em>Monster Manual</em></strong> and 2nd Edition <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong> say they are. Still, the DM could rule that the normal undead-creation process (in which a being killed by certain undead beings becomes an undead creature, too) is magical. Expanding the list in this fashion logically would include lycanthropes (which suffer from a quasi-magical curse), golems (which are ritually created), creatures such as owlbears and bulettes (commonly known to be magical crossbreeds), and gargoyles (which have "magical natures")—and the list goes on. It's much better to draw the line early on.<br>&emsp;The rules don't say that clerics have power over <em>all</em> undead. Banshees were left off the clerics vs. undead table in the AD&D 1st Edition <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> because they couldn't be turned in those rules (see the 1st Edition <strong><em>Monster Manual</em></strong>, "Groaning Spirit"). Currently, banshees can be turned as "special" undead (see "Groaning Spirit," <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong>, Volume 2).</span>

#156-14">🔗</a><br/><strong>Why does a paladin's immunity to disease protect him from attack by green slime, violet fungi, and other plant monsters?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;In my opinion, it doesn't. My editor <em>[me again]</em> assumed that since green slime can be killed with a <strong><em>cure disease</em></strong> spell, paladins must be immune to its effects. However, green slime is a monster with the ability to destroy flesh, wood, and metal. A disease is a malady caused by a pathogenic organism; a paladin's immunity to disease does not protect him or his equipment from a green slime's attack, its susceptibility to <strong><em>cure disease</em></strong> spells notwithstanding. Similarly, a violet fungi's flesh-destroying attack works on paladins, even though <strong><em>cure disease</em></strong> spells halt its effects. Furthermore, paladins can get infected wounds (if your campaign considers them), as these are not diseases per se; <strong><em>cure disease</em></strong> spells also remove such infections.</span>

The spell allowed the recipient weapon to harm creatures hit only by magical weapons, but it did not bestow any bonuses whatsoever. Consequently, I tread lightly around the subject in the column. The new <strong><em>enchanted weapon</em></strong> spell, however, does bestow a true bonus and is useful for enchanting most weapons, as described in the 2nd Edition <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 157.</span>

#157-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> be healed with a <strong><em>cure light wounds</em></strong> spell? How would a spell such as <strong><em>enlarge</em></strong> affect a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong>? Can a character detect a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> just by talking to it awhile? How do spells like <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> and <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> affect <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong>? Since <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong> are made of snow, are they especially susceptible to fire or heat?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong>, once completed, is a creature—not an object—made of nonliving matter; it's a construct something like a golem. Most spells that affect creatures also affect <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong>. Spells like <strong><em>magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, haste</em></strong>, and <strong><em>protection from normal missiles</em></strong>, which affect only creatures, also work on <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong>. So do spells like <strong><em>charms</em></strong> and <strong><em>holds</em></strong>, if the creature that the <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> duplicates can be affected by those spells.<br>&emsp;A <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> is composed entirely of nonliving matter and is not truly alive. Consequently, curative spells do not work on <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong>, and repairing damage done to them is a difficult and costly process (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 186). (In the AD&D 1st Edition game, a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> could be <strong><em>enlarged</em></strong> or <strong><em>reduced</em></strong> at the lower, nonliving matter rate.) <strong><em>Simulacrums</em></strong> do not need to breathe or eat, through they usually do so to avoid detection.<br>&emsp;Once completed, a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> cannot be <strong><em>dispelled</em></strong> or rendered nonfunctional by a <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> spell. <strong><em>Anti-magic shells</em></strong> keep <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong> and other magically created creatures at bay (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 173), but <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> in any form does not. A <strong><em>Mordenkainen's disjunction</em></strong> spell can destroy <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong> just as it can destroy magical items; the creature's chance to resist the <strong><em>disjunction</em></strong> is based on its creator's level (or on level 14, if the creator's level is unknown).<br>&emsp;<strong><em>Simulacrums</em></strong> usually cannot be detected by nonmagical means, since each one is a functioning replica of some creature; however, the replica's degree of accuracy is variable (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 186), and the DM might give players subtle clues as to the creature's actual nature. Very poor <strong><em>simulacrums</em></strong> (having less than 55% of the original's hit points and knowledge) probably shy away from flame or intense heat, and they might speak in monotones. Characters who are quite familiar with the original creature should have no problem finding gaps in the <strong><em>simulacrum's</em></strong> knowledge, as even the best <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> has only 65% of the copied creature's knowledge and personality, but all such clues to the creature's true nature should be provided through role-playing. For example, a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> of a character might lack the original's zest for apple cider, lack an unusual nonweapon proficiency, and lack the original's distaste for undercooked meat. Only very perceptive players should be able to detect a <strong><em>simulacrum</em></strong> in this manner.</span>

Spell-casting negates dexterity bonuses to armor class, but does not otherwise make the caster easier to hit. Most DMs allow spell-casters to defend normally after a spell is completed, so that the caster can use his dexterity bonus (if any) against any attacks made then. It usually isn't possible for any kind of spell-caster to cast two or more spells in the same melee round, even if the caster is using a <strong><em>haste</em></strong> spell or <strong><em>potion of speed</em></strong>.</span>

Does a mage have to delete spells from his book if an item, creature, or curse lowers his intelligence score?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Even temporary increases in a magic user's intelligence score increase the character's chance to learn spells. (The increase provided by an <strong><em>ioun stone</em></strong> is temporary because it lasts only as long as the character keeps and uses the item.) The character cannot immediately try to relearn spells he has failed to learn before, but he can try them again at his increased success chance when he gains a new experience level (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 16). The maximum spells per level rule is optional. If your campaign uses it, the character's spell limit increases along with his intelligence. If the character manages to learn a new spell and write it into his book while his intelligence score is temporarily raised, it stays there even if his intelligence subsequently drops. Intelligence losses of any kind do not affect spell books. However, the DM could rule that not every spell could be replaced if the character's spell book is lost or destroyed and had to be reconstructed.</span>

What if the caster is using a magical item? Can spell-casters who have their spells ruined attack the same round as the spells were lost?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Spells and scrolls are used up and lost if they are disrupted during casting. Some magical items require a "casting" procedure that can also be disrupted; these include wands, staves, and rods if the command word optional rule is in effect. (This assumes that the "command word" is actually a phrase or rhyme; perhaps the wielder must actually accompany the speaking of the phrase or rhyme with some kind of somatic gestures.) If wand, stave, or rod use is disrupted, the appropriate charges are expended and lost. Rings, weapons, armor, and miscellaneous magical items generally have very short command words or sequences (if they have any at all) and usually cannot be disrupted. Some wands, staves, and rods that are usable by non-spell-casters, such as the <strong><em>rod of lordly might</em></strong> and <strong><em>wand of secret door and trap location</em></strong>, tend to have very simple command words or sequences and also cannot be disrupted.

Would nonmonetary wealth (such as a mount, property, or armor) be included in income?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Income is, literally, incoming or "new" wealth. Savings, equipment, and property are not income. As explained in the AD&D 2nd Edition rules, however, tithing is not the limit of a paladin's largess (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 28). The 10% tithe is paid immediately before the paladin does <em>anything</em> else with his income.

#157-9">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a mage use a <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> spell to travel into and out of a castle built on a drifting cloud? Or would the cloud's motion make <strong><em>teleporting</em></strong> impossible?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Unless there is some outside force preventing it (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 172), a character can <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> from anywhere. Particularly strict DMs might rule that any momentum the <strong><em>teleporting</em></strong> character has will carry over after the <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> is complete. For example, if a wizard <strong><em>teleports</em></strong> out of a runaway mine car, he still might be in for a whopping impact at his destination. Unless the DM decides that the magic needed to keep a cloud castle aloft blocks <strong><em>teleportation</em></strong>, it is possible to <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> to that castle. Motion is not a factor in determining what constitutes a viable destination for a teleport spell. In a sun-centered solar system, every piece of a planet's surface constantly undergoes complex motions as the planet rotates, revolves around its star, and hurtles through space with the rest of the system (not to mention any tectonic motions in the planet's crust). Nevertheless, one can <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> to any place on the planet. The key word is "place." A piece of ground, an asteroid, and a castle are all places and thus can be the destinations of a <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> spell even if they are in motion. Any other place that can provide a substantial surface as required in the spell description will also serve. Stability goes hand in hand with substance in this case; a constantly changing surface such as a flowing stream, patch of quicksand, or heaving ship's deck cannot be a destination for a <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> spell. Note that carts, wagons, ships, and other conveyances are objects, not "places." A character can <strong><em>teleport</em></strong> from such locations, but not to them.</span>

Can it raise a score from 18 to 19?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The rules on ability-score minimums and maximums (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 20) make it clear that the limits apply only to characters when they are being created. So if a character actually lives long enough to get an intelligence or wisdom boost (these are the only ability scores that <em>increase</em> with age), I see no reason why he shouldn't get the full benefit. Note that magical aging does not improve intelligence and wisdom; only actual life experience does that.</span>

I suppose a wizard could memorize a spell from a scroll, but doing so would use up the scroll, as would writing the scrolls spell into a book. This being the case, I should think the advantage of taking the time to make a permanent record of the spell in a book is obvious.</span>

#158-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>What are-the size, speed factor, and other statistics for the scythe wielded by the minor death produced by a deck of many things (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 166-167)?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Speed factor is irrelevant in the case of the minor death; it always strikes first. In a character's hands, a scythe makes a cumbersome weapon at best. I suggest the following statistics: cost 5 gp; weight 7 lbs.; size L; type P/S (the blade has both a curved cutting edge and a sharp point); speed factor 10; damage 2d4 (S-M)/1dG (L).</span>

#158-2">🔗</a><br/><strong>Where is the table for determining what kind of coins can be found in a <strong><em>Bucknard's everful purse</em></strong>? How long can the purse be empty before it becomes nonmagical? I know the book says "a few minutes," but what does that really mean?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The table was accidentally printed on page 160 of the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, under the heading <strong><em>"BAG OF TRANSMUTING."</em></strong> Individual DMs are free to define "a few minutes," but I suppose 2-5 minutes is a good base value. The real intent behind the "few minutes" comment is to say that a character is free to empty the purse and get his daily crop of coins, but must put at least one coin back in before he goes off and does anything else. Most DMs rule that a coin of each type must be present to get the full effect; for example, if a purse could produce silver, electrum, and gold, then leaving just one silver piece inside would keep it functioning—but the next day it would produce only silver pieces.</span>

#158-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>How come chain mail costs less than armor that doesn't protect as the wearer well? Chain mail, for instance, costs 75 gp, vs. 120 gp for scale mail. This is a misprint, right?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;No misprint. Scale mail costs more to make than chain mail, but its older, less efficient design makes it inferior to chain mail. The same goes for ring mail (cost 100 gp). People who know how to make chain mail needn't bother with scale or ring mail. What kind of armor is available in any given campaign depends on the time period in which the game is set (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 35).</span>

#158-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong> containing a <strong><em>find familiar</em></strong> spell enable a nonwizard character to summon a familiar? How long would it take to cast <strong><em>find familiar</em></strong> from a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong>? How does the "one attempt per year" rule apply to characters using a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong>?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;It is perfectly reasonable to say that only wizards have the mental training to maintain the empathic link between master and familiar. It also is perfectly reasonable to say that a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong> is powerful enough to make any spell stored within it work for the ring's owner. Individual DMs must decide on their own which is the case. Any spell cast from a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong> has a casting time of five. The character who puts the spell into the ring, however, must go through the spell's normal casting procedure. In this case, the wizard must fire up the brazier full of incense and spend up to 24 hours casting. Note that this makes it very unlikely that <strong><em>find familiar</em></strong> will be found in a <strong><em>ring of spell storing</em></strong> and even more unlikely that NPC spell-casters can be hired to restore it to the ring. The "one attempt per year" limit applies to both the ring and the owner; that is, only one attempt can be made each year with any given ring, and a character who has two rings cannot try to summon a familiar twice in the same year by using each ring once.</span>

#158-5">🔗</a><br/><strong>My wife and I have a continuing argument over the properties of the <strong><em>vorpal blade</em></strong>. She insists that strength bonuses are considered when determining whether the weapon severs a victim's neck. I point out that the footnote on page 186 of the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> says only the sword's +3 bonus affects the score required to sever.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is probably the first time I've been asked to settle a domestic argument. Bonuses for strength, specialization, spells (such as <strong><em>bless</em></strong> or <strong><em>prayer</em></strong>), situation (opponent surprised, prone, etc.), or the like do not affect the score needed to sever. Thus, it is quite possible to solidly hit an opponent, due to a good roll and high bonuses, but not sever his neck. In fact, the table could—and probably should—read as follows (the same table can be used for the <strong><em>sword of sharpness</em></strong>):</span><br/><img src="../img/sage_advice_158_q05.png"/>

Is the award given for every monster the party defeats?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The formula is the monster's hit dice multiplied by 10. The word "level" is a misprint. All individual awards are just that; they are awarded to characters who do things without help from other characters. For fighters, the individual award for defeating a monster is made after a one-on-one contest.</span>

#158-9">🔗</a><br/><strong>How come red dragons in the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong> have fewer hit dice than blue dragons and no more hit dice than green dragons? What does the red dragon's THAC0 entry, "7 (at 9 HD)," mean? Also, the example in the general information section says that a black dragon's base hit dice is 10, but the black dragon's description says the base is 12 HD.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;There is a typo in the red dragon's statistics. A red dragon's base hit dice is 15; a black dragon's base hit dice is 12 (the example is wrong). All dragons' THAC0s are determined by their adjusted hit dice, so a hatchling red dragon (9 HD) has a THAC0 of 11.</span>

#158-10">🔗</a><br/><strong>Is there some mistake in the horse listing in the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong>? I mean, simple riding horses have more hit dice and a better THAC0 than light or medium war horses, and they move a lot faster than medium war horses.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;There sure seems to be an error. If you want to cut riding horses down to size, just treat them as light war horses with one attack (a bite) for 1-2 hp damage. Regardless of statistics, non-war horses are nervous creatures that are more likely to flee than to fight.</span>

#158-11">🔗</a><br/><strong>What do the "juvenile" entries in the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium's</em></strong> giant experience-point value entries mean? Why are young giants treated like adult giants of different species? Shouldn't young giants have abilities that reflect those of adults of their own race? If young giants are treated as adult members of other races, shouldn't you use those races' experience values? Just how tall are young giants?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Those mysterious experience-point values are part of an aborted attempt to do just what you suggest—extrapolate juvenile abilities from adult abilities. However, this was dropped during the editing process to keep things simple and to keep the revised giants more compatible with the ones in the AD&D 1st Edition game. The juvenile experience-point values were printed in error and should be ignored; use the experience values from the appropriate race when making experience awards for juvenile giants.<br>&emsp;If you want to derive young giants' abilities from adult members of the race, here's the discarded system: To determine an immature giant's age randomly, roll 1d4 A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat abilities and -4 hit points per die (minimum 1 hp/HD). Other rolls indicate juveniles with penalties to hit points, attack rolls, and damage done equal to the die roll. Juveniles in the -3 category also do one less die of damage per blow. For example, a -1 hill giant juvenile would have -1 hp/HD (with a minimum of 1 hp/ HD) and a THAC0 of 10, and would do 1d6 - 1 hp damage with its fists or 2d6 + 6 with a club. A -3 hill giant has -3 hp/HD, a THAC0 of 12, does 1d6 -3 hp damage with its fist or 1d6 +4 with a club. Juveniles can hurl rocks; their minimum range is the same as an adult's, and the maximum range is equal to the adult maximum minus a value equal to 10 yards times the juvenile's combat penalty; the combat penalty also is subtracted from each die of damage that the rock does (minimum of 1 hp/damage die). For example, a -1 juvenile hill giant can hurl a rock from three to 190 yards for 2d8 - 2 hp damage.<br>&emsp;Infant giants are less than one-quarter the height of an adult, but are usually not less than one-sixth adult height. Juveniles are anywhere from one-quarter adult height to full adult height; a -3 juvenile would be from one-quarter to one-half adult height, a -2 juvenile would be from one-half to three-quarters adult height, and so on.</span>

#158-12">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can you play the FRE-series Avatar modules alter reading the books?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;According to Avatar project coordinator Jim Lowder, the story as told in the three, Avatar books—<strong><em>Shadowdale</em></strong>, <strong><em>Tantras</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Waterdeep</em></strong>—does not compromise play of the modules at all. The books tell the story of a group of fallen deities struggling to regain their powers. The modules deal with the mortals who help them.</span>

#159-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>The description of the troll in the <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium</em></strong> says that any hit with a "natural" 20 severs a limb. Does this apply to attacks against other creatures? If not, why does the game have the seventh- level priest spell <strong><em>regenerate</em></strong>?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Trolls are thin and rubbery, and are prone to being hacked apart, although hacking apart a troll doesn't do much good. Unless the DM creates his own critical-hit system, it's not possible to hack limbs off other creatures in combat. However, <strong><em>swords of sharpness</em></strong>, monsters such as green slime, crude forms of medieval justice, and many other hazards in the game can lead to the loss of limbs—hence the <strong><em>regenerate</em></strong> spell.</span>

#159-6">🔗</a><br/><strong>Can a <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> wielder (from FR7 <strong><em>Hall of Heroes</em></strong>, pages 49-50) ever return to his original class? Can a <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> wielder absorb clerical spell energy? If so, is this voluntary or involuntary? What happens to <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> wielders who absorb more energy than their limit? How do you determine if a character can have <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> ability?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A character with <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> powers never actually leaves his original class. However, to gain experience in his original class, the character must refrain from using any <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> abilities during an adventure. If the character does use a <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> ability, all experience earned during that adven- ture goes toward the character's <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> level, except for individual experience awards for the character's original class (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 48), which are lost.<br>&emsp;<strong><em>Spellfire</em></strong> wielders can absorb magical energy from almost any source: spells of all types, breath weapons, gaze attacks, and just about anything else. At the 1st level of <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> ability, absorption is involuntary; the character drains any magic with which he comes in contact, including useful magical items and healing spells (only rest or nonmagical healing can heal damage to the character). Absorption is strictly voluntary at 2nd level and above.<br>&emsp;Exactly what happens if the character exceeds his limit is unrevealed. I suggest that either the character becomes unable to absorb more energy once he reaches the limit and consequentially is affected normally by any magic with which he comes in contact while "full," or he absorbs the excess and automatically releases one level of energy each segment (10 times per round), suffering 1-6 hp damage each time, until his total energy falls back into the "10 x constitution" category.<br>&emsp;<strong><em>Spellfire</em></strong> is a variant type of magic created by Ed Greenwood in his novel of the same name. Only the DM can decide if a particular character can have the ability. It seems likely that only one <strong><em>spellfire</em></strong> wielder can be alive at a time on any given world, and that the ability is hereditary.</span>

#159-7">🔗</a><br/><strong>Why can't halflings be rangers? Halflings can be clerics, and rangers have a few clerical spells. Why can't gnomes be bards? Gnomes are known for their sense of humor and should have access to some kind of jester-type abilities. Why can't [my favorite race] become [my favorite class], since [several dozen good reasons why this race/class combination is justified exist]?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Game logic and game balance require that demihumans have limited character-class options. According to game logic, halflings don't become rangers because they aren't inclined to be. Halflings who really like the outdoors and nature become druids. Halflings who are nimble and good at hiding become thieves; that's just the way halflings are. Gnomes who feel roguish become thieves themselves. Those who tend toward flashy expositions become illusionists. (Illusionists, by the way, have an almost infinite capacity for vivid storytelling and practical jokes, as even a quick look at the spells in the illusion/ phantasm spell school will show.)<br>&emsp;Only humans have the ability to become any class they want to be (ability scores permitting), and they can advance all the way to level 20. That's what makes humans unique. Demihumans have completely different psychological, physical, and spiritual makeups from humans; that's what makes each demihuman race unique. Overall, demihumans are not nearly so versatile or adaptable as are humans, because all have special skills and limitations derived from their heredity and culture that simply close some doors to them when they seek professions. Game balance requires that each race in the game be equally playable. If demihumans—with their infravision, special resistances, and special abilities—could freely choose from every character class in the game, there wouldn't be much reason to play a human character. As I've said before, the D&D® and AD&D games are games of choices; to get something, you've got to give up something else. Good players make the right choices most of the time and know how to capitalize on their characters' strengths while finding ways to circumvent their weaknesses. While changing the rules to eliminate character weaknesses is one way to circumvent them, it isn't a clever or heroic one.</span>

Also, do tinker gnomes have any alignment restrictions?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A tinker gnome with enough common sense to fight with a simple weapon in- stead of an outrageous gnomish device uses the magic-user THAC0 chart (see the Rule Book of Taladas, pages 3-4, from the <strong><em>Time of the Dragon</em></strong> boxed set). Tinker gnomes gain one weapon and two non- weapon proficiencies every three levels, as indicated in <strong><em>DLA</em></strong>, page 117. Most tinker gnomes are lawful good or neutral good, though any nonevil, nonchaotic alignment is acceptable.</span>

Generally they disdain magic, but PC tinkers can use any magical item except those usable only by bards, wizards, clerics, or their sub-classes. When using proficiencies from the AD&D 2nd Edition game, tinkers can choose proficiencies from the following groups: general, priest, and wizard. Rogue and warrior skills can be selected at double-normal cost.</span>

However there are cloistered religious orders of clerics dedicated to the gods, and these clerics may be labeled "monks" in the historical sense of the word.

Also, the spell <strong><em>kiss of night's guardian</em></strong> is listed as an evocation spell; does this mean that only wizards of the White Robes can cast it?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;As shown in the Krynn spell summary (see <strong><em>DLA</em></strong>, page 126), invocation and evocation spells are part of the same group. Spells that create something out of virtually nothing or that release raw power fall into this category. Generally, "invocation" implies that the effect comes as the result of a petition to a greater power, while "evocation" implies the effect was compelled. This is why most clerical invocation/evocations are listed as invocations. The fact that the order of the Red Robes calls its invocation/evocation spells "invocations" could give a clue to its basic approach to magic, or it could be just a clever use of names.<br>&emsp;Exactly who can cast <strong><em>kiss of night’s guardian</em></strong> is unrevealed. It seems to be the personal prerogative of the master of the Tower of High Sorcery at Palanthus.</span>

They usually cannot be purchased; a relative or friend gives an adventuring kender his first hoopak.

If the character gains a new level for <strong><em>any</em></strong> reason without practicing the skill at least once, the skill is lost.

If so, what happens to a character who has penalties totalling more than 100%? What constitutes practicing a skill?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Zero-level characters are untried, enthusiastic, and flexible; this gives them leave to obtain a whole range of abilities that less callow adventurers can't get (as explained on pages 117-118). However, the shortcuts, blind stabs, and side explorations beginners make <strong><em>must</em></strong> be abandoned if they are ever to become really skilled at anything. Thus characters have to do a little backstepping when they reach first level. The experience penalties <strong><em>are</em></strong> cumulative, but optional. A character can drop a skill and avoid the experience penalty at any time. In the case of penalties totalling more than 100%, the character <strong><em>must</em></strong> abandon skills until the penalties total 100% or less. DMs are free to set their own standards for skill practice. I suggest the characters practice their skills during nonadventuring time according to the rules on page 119. The character must accumulate as many study points as originally required to learn the skill, and retains the knowledge for three months per study point earned. If a character successfully uses a skill one or more times during an adventure, extend his knowledge one month.</span>

However, the <strong><em>head</em></strong> cleric at a temple always can, in time of need, call on spell-like powers granted by the deity—even if the cleric is of insufficient level to have the ability and even if the cleric has "used up" his daily allotment of the ability. The DM must decide what events are times of special need as they arise, but they always should include times when the temple is being invaded and any time the deity's power is in question and the cleric must—or should— demonstrate it.</span>

#161-14">🔗</a><br/><strong>I'm having a lot of trouble fitting the <strong><em>City of Waterdeep Trail Map</em></strong> with the <strong><em>Kara-Tur Trail Map</em></strong>. The closest match I can get leaves a big gap near the Great Sea and a rather abrupt end to the Dust Desert.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Here's how things were explained to me: The Waterdeep map is drawn from a western perspective. The farther east you go, the less accurate it gets because westerners don't know a lot about the East. Likewise, the Kara-Tur map is drawn from an eastern perspective and gets less accurate the farther west you go. In any event, remember that the boxed sets are meant to be campaign settings. Each DM's campaign is going to be a little different. An area where even the published information is uncertain provides the DM with at least one mysterious place where only he knows what's going on (at least until PCs actually explore it).<br>&emsp;It sounds to me like you're going about fitting the maps together in the right way. The maps match pretty well if you just line up the borders, but you have to adjust a little to match the city of Solon (which is shown on both maps) and the southern and northern coastlines. When overlapping the maps, I suggest putting the <strong><em>Kara-Tur</em></strong> map on top, as the mountains east of Solon really are there. Individual DMs will have to decide where the Dust Desert really ends—the edges would vary with the annual weather anyhow. The empty gap in the south is unexplored territory, but there has been some discussion of filling it in with an Arabian land.</span>

There are, however, plenty of libraries. Sages, guilds, and governments keep extensive collections of books and scrolls, but access to them is on a need-to-know basis (or pay-as-you-go, in the case of sages). For example, any large and prosperous shipwrights' guild would have a library with volumes on ship design and construction, carpentry, forestry, logging, blacksmithing, rope making, weaving, sewing, and a host of other subjects, both practical and esoteric, related to shipbuilding. Members would use the library as a resource for training new members and for answering difficult or unforeseen questions that might come up during day-to-day business. The guild also would jealously guard its library to prevent competitors in other cities from learning its professional secrets and to prevent those people who are not guild members—like adventurers—from learning how to build their own ships and putting dues-paying guild members out of work.

  <h2>Sage Advice #162, October 1990</h2>
  <h3>Once again, the sage looks back to re- consider some old advice. Page numbers refer to rulebooks for the AD&D® 2nd Edition game.</h3>
  <p id="162-1">Sage Advice #162 (October 1990) p. 32, Question:1
    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('162-1')" title="Copy to clipboard">📋</button>&ensp;<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DBFBlackbull/adnd-2e-sage-advice/blob/master/html/index.html
#162-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>I could not believe my eyes when I read your answer to the question about the cost of chain mail in issue #158. I, too, thought the prices had been misprinted. Your response that scale mail costs more to make than chain mail is idiotic and grossly unhistorical. Chain mail is made of wire (itself difficult and expensive to make) that is formed into links that are interlocked, then soldered or welded together. In the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., a Roman armorer, using techniques that remained essentially unchanged throughout the Middle Ages, could make four or five suits of chain mail a year. By contrast, scale mail uses metal plates—not wire—that are simply sewn onto a leather shirt.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;To reiterate, the base cost of chain mail in the AD&D 2nd Edition game is 75 gp, and the base cost of scale mail is 120 gp. Itemized breakdowns of the costs of manufacture for each type of armor are given on page 6 of the <strong><em>Complete Fighter's Handbook</em></strong>. Your estimate of the construction time for chain mail agrees with the table in the <strong><em>Complete Fighter's Handbook</em></strong>, where an unsupervised apprentice working in a properly equipped shop can make a suit of chain mail in 10 weeks (5.2 suits a year). However, <em>two</em> apprentices working under the same conditions take eight weeks to make a suit of scale mail (16 man-weeks in all). Scale mail requires more raw materials (60 gp worth) than does chain mail (38 gp worth); chain mail's rings require less labor and metal than scale mail's plates.<br>&emsp;Note, however, that chain mail and scale mail come from two different historical periods. (See the <strong><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></strong>, page 35, for a discussion of time periods in the AD&D game and their associated technology.) Scale mail, an ancient armor type, had all but disappeared by the time chain mail came into common use during the Middle Ages. Obviously, if you have a campaign set right on the borderline between the end of the Ancient period (when the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> says chain mail doesn't exist at all) and the beginnings of the Dark Ages, about 1100 A.D. or so, chain mail is going to be very expensive. There are several reasons for this. First, chain mail would represent the newest and best concept in body armor—keeping up with the latest developments is always costly. Second, the manufacturing techniques and advanced metallurgy that made chain mail economical to manufacture during the Middle Ages would not yet have been invented. Third, from a campaign standpoint, chain mail <em>should</em> be more expensive than scale mail; you can kiss your play balance goodbye if the best armor available isn't also the most costly. You are free to set your own cost for chain mail in such a setting, but I recommend at least double (150 gp) and triple (225 gp) normal prices would not be unreasonable. Furthermore, chain mail in this setting probably would be made of iron, not steel, as the equipment list in the <strong><em>Player's Handbook</em></strong> assumes. Such chain mail would weigh 50 lbs. instead of the listed 40 lbs., or 25% more (see <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 38).<br>&emsp;Speaking of the "unhistorical": One does not have to have wire to make chain mail. The Romans used rings cut, punched, or drilled from sheets of metal. The Romans and ancient Chinese probably also had access to cast rings. Wire was pretty rare in medieval Europe, and most wire was gold, silver, or copper for use in jewelry and adornments. Medieval armorers almost certainly made their chain mail from rods that they forged themselves from ingots or bars; this is not as difficult as it sounds, especially when the armorer knew what he was doing and had his whole life to practice the skill. (Note that making a rod from a chunk of raw metal takes a lot less hammering than what would be required to make a flat plate out of the same piece of metal.) Furthermore, the chain mail currently preserved in museums and private collections is not soldered or welded, but riveted; in most cases, however, the rivets were hammered so carefully that the links <em>appear</em> to be welded. Finally, not all chain mail had its links fastened. Ancient armorers often simply linked the rings, as did their successors when they were in a hurry or wanted to cut costs. This generally made inferior armor, but Oriental armorers often made very good unriveted chain mail (as good as riveted mail) by using a superior alloy and by making each ring from two or three coils of rod.<br>&emsp;For readers who are interested in learning more about the manufacture of chain mail and other types of armor, I recommend <strong><em>A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor</em></strong>, by George Cameron Stone. The book is uncommon but is available at better used book stores and at large libraries.</span>

#162-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>To answer your question in issue #156 (page 55, third column): Yes, those questions do arise during play. Now that you know this, perhaps you'd reconsider your answer to the "watery ranger" question. Where I'm from, characters get wished into glasses of water all the time (the idea originated in a fanzine), and your suggestion that such characters can be killed simply by drinking them is tough on PCs.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;First, if <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> are so common in your campaigns that they are used for anything "all the time," you've got too many <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> floating around; cut back. Note that a <strong><em>wish</em></strong> is the only magic in the core AD&D rules that can turn a character into a glass of water. <strong><em>Polymorph any object</em></strong> can turn organic matter into inorganic matter, but into only one kind of matter at a time; a successful spell could turn a character into a glass, or into water, but not both.<br>&emsp;Second, <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> are <em>not</em> intended to be used as direct attacks on creatures. Such <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> fall into the grossly unfair category (see <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 197), and the DM should actively subvert the intent of such spells whenever they are used, even when they are used by NPCs. Thus, if an evil wizard <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> a PC "into a glass of water." a huge glass containing the PC and many gallons of water should appear; rest assured that at least one novel twist exists for each possible wording of this <strong><em>wish</em></strong>.<br>&emsp;Third, this <strong><em>wish</em></strong> should allow a saving throw, since it is being used as a high-powered <strong><em>polymorph any object</em></strong> spell.<br>&emsp;Fourth, any <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> character retains his hit points. Drinking the character will cause harm just as surely as eating the character would, but if the character has 100 hp, drinking the character is going to be a long and difficult process. Water in a glass has no armor class (it just sits there), but the most damage a human can do by drinking is 1-2 hp per round. Note that big, nasty teeth have no real effect on water, but a large tongue does, so a dragon or cow might be able to "drink" 1-12 hp each round. Also, as TSR editor Jon Pickens points out, if a character is turned into a <em>glass</em> of water, a few of his hit points will be held in the glass (say 10-20% of the total), and the glass must be smashed before the character can be killed; this, too, is easier said than done if the victim has a lot of hit points.<br>&emsp;Finally, although evaporation or spillage can "kill" the character, death won't be instantaneous. An evaporated character is effectively in gaseous form until his molecules are thoroughly dispersed in the atmosphere; a kind DM might rule that the gaseous state lasts indefinitely. Similarly, a watery character poured into the dirt and allowed to soak in can be considered melded into stone and not truly dead.</span>

Furthermore, <strong><em>Oriental Adventures</em></strong> itself says that a yakuza has a chance to pick pockets equal to that of a ninja of the same level.

#163-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>One of my characters was recently tricked into donning a <strong><em>girdle of femininity/masculinity</em></strong>. What options do I have for getting the character back to normal? If the character finds another such girdle and puts it on, will this change him back? My DM says this won't work because the item's description says a <strong><em>wish</em></strong> has only a 50% chance of restoring the character's original sex. Obviously, a <strong><em>polymorph other</em></strong> spell could restore the character, but I'm leery of <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> and <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> spells.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;It isn't often that I get a question with so many ... possibilities.<br>&emsp;What a <strong><em>wish</em></strong> will do is irrelevant in this case; the <strong><em>girdle’s</em></strong> absolute power to change the character's gender is stronger than the <strong><em>wish’s</em></strong> general power to remove misfortune. (Several powerful miscellaneous magical items are more potent within their limited portfolios than <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> are.) If the character dons a second girdle, he might have his gender restored, or he might lose all gender—and your DM might rule that this is more likely than the standard 10% chance (<strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 170), since the character is fiddling around with things best left alone. But your character's gender <em>will</em> be altered if he puts on a second <strong><em>girdle</em></strong>, as these items are quite potent.<br>&emsp;There is nothing in the <strong><em>polymorph other</em></strong> spell listing to suggest that secondary characteristics like age or gender can be altered by the spell. Individual DMs are free to include the ability to change gender along with form, but players shouldn't count on it without consulting the DM. Furthermore, assuming that your DM does allow <strong><em>polymorph other</em></strong> to change gender, there would be at least a 50% chance that the attempt would fail. A <strong><em>wish</em></strong> certainly is more powerful than the 4th-level <strong><em>polymorph other</em></strong>. If the character was <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> back to his original gender, a system-shock roll would be required. A successful <strong><em>dispel magic</em></strong> would change the character back to the "wrong" gender and would require another system-shock roll.<br>&emsp;You are quite right to be worried about <strong><em>anti-magic shells</em></strong>, but note that an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong> cannot permanently dispel a long-term effect such as <strong><em>polymorph other</em></strong>. The effect temporarily dampens magic, it does not dispel it. If the <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> character entered an <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong>, he would be forced back into the "wrong" form, and this would require a system-shock roll. Upon leaving the <strong><em>anti-magic shell</em></strong>, the character immediately would resume the "correct" form, and another system-shock roll would be in order.</span>

#163-2">🔗</a><br/><strong>How is each spell's school chosen? Also please explain how the various pairs of opposing schools of magic were chosen. What is the nature of the opposition? Why do illusionists have to contend with an extra opposition school?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Generally, spells are grouped into schools according to the types of effects they produce and, by extension, the type of power used to produce their effects. Abjuration blocks, dispels, or protects; alteration produces changes in its target; conjuration/summoning brings material from some other place; enchantment/ charm grants its users or targets special abilities; greater divination reveals information; illusion/phantasm causes perceived changes that are not real; invocation/evocation creates matter or energy; and necromancy provides or removes the energy of life. See <strong><em>The Complete Wizard’s Handbook</em></strong> for detailed explanations of each school.<br>&emsp;No two schools of magic are mutually hostile due to their natures; opposition arises from how the spells are learned and used. Specialist wizards employ methods of study and mental discipline that enhance their abilities to use certain types of magic and erode their aptitudes for others. This is why generalists can freely use magic from opposing schools while specialists cannot. Specific pairs of opposed schools were selected according to common sense and game balance. For example, if invokers spend a lot of time learning how to bring things into being from nothing, they probably neglect to learn how to call things from one place to another. Illusionists, who spend their time trying to create believable unrealities, have a hard time casting magic that produces and channels real energies; there are three such schools: invocation/evocation, necromancy, and abjuration.</span>

#163-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>I've noticed that a few spells are parts of two opposing schools of magic. For example, the <strong><em>limited wish</em></strong> spell is both conjuration/ summoning and invocation/evocation. Can specialist wizards from either school use such spells? That is, can conjurers or invokers use <strong><em>limited wish</em></strong>? How is it that a spell can be from two opposing schools anyway?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A specialist wizard can use any spell that falls within the schools allowed to him, even if the spell in question also falls under an opposing school. Certain effects, such as <strong><em>limited wishes</em></strong>, can be produced in more than one way; in this case, what is <strong><em>wished</em></strong> for can be plucked from some other place and delivered, or it can simply be created to order.</span>

#163-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>How do you calculate a multi-classed or dual-classed character's personality score or chance to detect scrying?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;For a multiclassed character, use either the character's highest level or the level of the pertinent class. For example, a fighter/ wizard would use his fighter level when calculating his personality score in a conflict with an egotistical magical weapon, but would use his wizard level to determine his chance to detect scrying. The DM should decide which method to use, then use it consistently. Dual-classed characters use the level of the class in which they are currently active. If the character has more experience in the previous class, he can use the higher level but must pay the experience penalty for reverting to that class (<strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 45).</span>

A <strong><em>spider climbing</em></strong> creature (or any other creature normally able to climb sheer surfaces or ceilings) can still traverse <strong><em>greased</em></strong> surfaces; however, if they fail their saves, they fall.</span>

#163-7">🔗</a><br/><strong>I'm confused by the castle construction section of <strong><em>The Castle Guide</em></strong>. When using smaller work forces (page 60), is the savings calculated once per project, or more often? The "Larger Work Forces" section on the same page suggests that the savings be calculated per week, but if that's the case a character could get a castle for free just by cutting the work force in half and waiting patiently through the increased construction time. Also, if a character is feeling frugal but still is in a hurry, what's to keep him from reducing the work force but keeping it above 75% of normal, thus gaining substantial savings and not extending construction time?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The savings from reduced work forces is calculated per week, so dropping one worker saves 520 gp each year. However, <strong><em>The Castle Guide</em></strong> editor Bill Connors says there is some dropped copy in the "Smaller Work Forces" section. The last sentence in the second paragraph should read: "No reduction below 50% in the work force or cost is possible." While a castle builder can reduce labor and administration costs, he can't get them for free and must still pay for materials. Smart castle builders will adjust their work forces to get some savings, but I can think of two ways to discourage this if the referee thinks the practice is getting out of hand. First, an accident or misfortune (such as a raid or marauding monster) might deplete a reduced work force even further and cause a construction delay. Second, morale in the reduced work force might deteriorate. Workers who believe they are being asked to do the impossible tend to be resentful. This might prompt the referee to recalculate the Production Modifier in mid-project and declare a "cost overrun" for the castle.</span>

    <button onclick="copyToClipboard('164-1')" title="Copy to clipboard">📋</button>&ensp;<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DBFBlackbull/adnd-2e-sage-advice/blob/master/html/index.html
#164-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>Will magic resistance stop gaze attacks? Can magic resistance stop <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> spells? How would magic resistance affect a paladin's <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> ability?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Magic resistance applies only to spells and spell-like powers that directly affect the magic-resistant creature. Consequential effects, such as collapsing masonry resulting from an earthquake spell, ignore magic resistance. Magic resistance applies to any effect created through the memorization and casting of a spell, and to spell-like effects from wands, staves, rods, rings, and miscellaneous magical items. It does <em>not</em> apply to breath weapons, gaze attacks, energy draining, psionic abilities, and similar special attack forms; nor does it apply to effects that are intrinsic to an item, such as the magical "pluses" on an enchanted weapon or piece of armor. There are many cases where effects fall into a gray area, and the DM must rule on these as they come up. When in doubt, treat any effect that behaves like a spell (i.e., that operates when the user does something special to create it—concentrates, expends a charge from an item, etc.) as a spell.<br>&emsp;Magic resistance can work against <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> spells; see the section on "in place" spells in the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 67, and in the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 102. However, many DMs rule that <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> is a special case, especially in campaigns where <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> is the only readily available defense against magic-resistant creatures. This is perfectly acceptable, since the power of <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> can be considered a consequential effect of a spell. A paladin's <strong><em>protection from evil</em></strong> power probably should be considered a special ability not subject to magic resistance, but it could be treated as a permanent magical effect (also see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 67, and the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 102).</span>

#164-2">🔗</a><br/><strong>If the last charge in a <strong><em>staff of the magi</em></strong> is used, are those powers that don't require charges still operative?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;No, the staff becomes completely nonfunctional. If you interpret the rules governing magical staves (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 153) strictly, once a staff is drained of charges it becomes permanently nonmagical. However, some DMs allow even totally drained <strong><em>staves of the magi</em></strong> to regain charges by absorbing spells.</span>

#164-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>The rules on scrolls in the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong> (page 145) say that a <strong><em>read magic</em></strong> spell must be used to discover a scroll's contents. According to this rule, even a map is unintelligible until a <strong><em>comprehend languages</em></strong> spell is used to decipher it. Since priests have neither <strong><em>read magic</em></strong> nor <strong><em>comprehend languages</em></strong> in their spell lists, how do priests discover what's on a scroll?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;You seem to have found a genuine "hole" in the rules. The DM can handle it in several ways:<br>&emsp;1. Assume that the <strong><em>read magic</em></strong> and <strong><em>comprehend languages</em></strong> spells can be bestowed upon the item itself. The caster touches the writing, and any single creature who can read (in the case of maps) or cast the type of spell written on the scroll can decipher the writing. Alternately, the caster can copy the map or simply explain the spell to another caster, who can then read the writing himself.<br>&emsp;2. Assume that a <strong><em>tongues</em></strong> spell can be used by priests to decipher scrolls, one scroll per spell.<br>&emsp;3. Introduce clerical versions of <strong><em>read magic</em></strong> and <strong><em>comprehend languages</em></strong> spells into your campaign. I recommend that you make them both first-level spells in the All sphere.<br>&emsp;4. Assume that all priests have a limited ability to decipher priestly scrolls on their own. A priest who does nothing else during a day might have a chance to petition his deity for help in deciphering one or more scrolls, provided he can read and write.</span>

#164-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>Where can I get information on herbs for the herbalism proficiency? Just what can a character do with this proficiency? How strong are the poisons and medicines the herbalist makes?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Check out the article "Wounds and Weeds" in DRAGON issue #82 for a quick description of several herbs with fantasygame applications. The reference section of your local library should also help. Herbalism mainly is used to identify plants and fungi. A successful proficiency check might reveal a plant's most common names and whether or not it is edible, poisonous, or medicinal. A successful proficiency check might also allow the herbalist to know where a certain plant grows and to find it if any are growing nearby. The DM must decide how powerful an herbal concoction is. In normal circumstances, I suggest that the herbalist be limited to mild poisons and weak healing balms. Mild poisons include types A, G, K, and O (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 73). Herbal healing balms might include poultices that heal 1 hp damage when applied to wounds, salves that allow a resting character to gain one extra hit point each day, and the like; characters with the healing proficiency might be able to use these products with greater effect, say to heal 1-4 hp damage or gain an extra 1-4 hp per day of rest. Of course, if the herbalist has access to extraordinary plants (such as those found in rain forests), he would be able to produce more potent concoctions.</span>

#164-5">🔗</a><br/><strong>There is a player character in my campaign who has spent several years of game time and thousands of gold pieces learning everything there is to know about poisons. What skills would he have? How many proficiency slots would he have to use? (I don't think the character should have to give up all his nonweapon proficiency slots after all that effort.) How would you simulate this skill in a game where the original AD&D game rules are used?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The DM should have been thinking about this while the PC was busy doing all his research. Since the game does not contain a poison-manufacturing proficiency <em>per se</em> (herbalism gives an incidental understanding of plant poisons, but many poisons are derived from animals or minerals), you'd have to create a new proficiency.<br>&emsp;Such a proficiency might require two proficiency slots and be based on Intelligence -2. Depending on the campaign, this proficiency would fall under one or more of the following categories: wizard, priest, rogue. The character would have to expend at least two slots to get the skill; the time and effort the character is devoting to learning all about poisons is not going to be available for learning languages or other skills. However, you might allow the character to purchase extra slots for improving the proficiency once it has been bought, but only if the character has no other slots available and the proficiency score is not raised above 16. The proficiency might allow the character to do one or more of the following, at the DM's option: concoct any poison on the DMG's poison table (see previous question); create entirely new poisons; prepare poison antidotes; recognize the "poison potential" in any plant, animal, or mineral encountered; recognize a poison by its effect on a victim.<br>&emsp;The DM must control such a proficiency very carefully to maintain play balance. Manufacturing poisons should be a long and difficult process (check the section on potion manufacture in the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 87). Making poison under field conditions should require a substantial penalty, and failure under any circumstances should result in at least a chance for the poison maker to poison himself ("Ouch! I've just nicked myself with the knife I used to skin that tree frog."). Many poisons, particularly the very potent ones, should have a "shelf life" and would thus lose potency over time. They also might be destroyed when exposed to heat, cold, light, or electricity. Note that poisons are very dangerous to store ("Fine, your thief is carrying that batch of puffer-fish venom in a leather bladder on his belt. But did he remember to wash his hands before eating?").<br>&emsp;The current proficiency system works fine with the original AD&D game rules. You can use this new proficiency, and any other one, with no modifications at all.</span>

#164-6">🔗</a><br/><strong>What abilities does the caster of a <strong><em>polymorph self</em></strong> spell gain when he assumes a new form? I understand that the spell-caster gets the new form's movement but not its attacks. What about extraordinary movement such as tunneling or phasing? What about types of movement that might double as attacks? For instance, can a wizard <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> into a giant frog leap onto an opponent?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Basically, the <strong><em>polymorph self</em></strong> spell grants the caster the adopted form's shape an ordinary locomotion. The spell does not grant the adopted form's special attacks, senses, or magical abilities. The caster is not granted enough strength to perform extraordinary maneuvers, and the DM must decide where to draw the line when deciding what abilities the caster does get. In your example, a caster who assumed the form of a giant frog would be able to swim and hop about, but would not have a frog's all-around vision or full use of the creature's remarkable tongue. It is reasonable to deny the caster the ability to make spectacular leaps, as the spell description specifically limits the caster to "normal" movement. However, a frog's form is well suited to jumping, and the occasional long hop isn't out of the ordinary for a frog. The caster could jump, but he probably wouldn't have the strength or coordination to make very long jumps (a reduction of one-half or one-third would be about right—60-90' for a person <strong><em>polymorphed</em></strong> into a 50-lb. giant frog) or to make several leaps in succession. The caster certainly can belly flop onto opponents; resolve such attacks using the wrestling table (see the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 59). Similarly, a caster who changed into an umber hulk would have a very limited ability to burrow through solid rock. A caster who took the form of a phase spider would get the ability to crawl along webs, but not the ability to shift phase or to spin webs of his own.</span>

#165-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>If a wizard casts a <strong><em>stoneskin</em></strong> spell on himself, then is struck in melee while casting another spell, is the second spell disrupted or is the wizard able to maintain concentration because the <strong><em>stoneskin's</em></strong> protection negates damage?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The second spell is disrupted, as a successful hit ruins a spell in progress (<strong><em>Player's Handbook</em></strong>, page 85). Note that a successful attack—not damage—is the critical factor here. Game logic assumes that even a nondamaging hit can disrupt concentration. It's tough to keep your mind focused on something as complex as a spell when someone's using your head for batting practice, even if the blows aren't hurting you. Many kinds of nondamaging hits can disrupt spell-casting: a hand clamped over the mouth, an armlock, or just being knocked down. However, damage always breaks concentration. If, for example, a spell-caster takes damage from a <strong><em>fireball</em></strong> or breath weapon, any spell in progress is lost even if the caster made his saving throw and took only half damage.<br>&emsp;These distinctions also are important to game balance. Spell-casters are <em>intended</em> to be vulnerable to physical attacks during spell-casting, and their opponents <em>must</em> be given a chance to anticipate the spell and disrupt it before it goes off. Spell-casters can't get around this limitation by using spells such as <strong><em>stoneskin</em></strong>. Likewise, spell-casting monsters that are immune to normal weapons (such as liches and vampires with character abilities) can have their spells ruined by any successful attacker. Some DMs even allow "attack" bonuses when characters make attacks specifically to disrupt a spell. The reasoning here is that a nondamaging jostle or cross block is easier to make than a potentially lethal blow. While this sort of ruling tends to be an equalizer when the target spell-caster is a high-level evil patriarch with an armor class in the negative numbers, it can be unreasonably tough on a 1st-level wizard with AC 10. Apply such bonuses carefully, if at all. I suggest that bonuses be limited to +4 or less, and you might consider applying them to the target's armor class rather than to the "to hit" roll. If you use the armor-class adjustment method, do not allow an armor class to be adjusted to worse than 10.</span>

#165-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>How are infravision and ultravision supposed to work? Do they work like infrared goggles that detect heat, or like "starlight" optics that simply gather large amounts of light?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Strictly speaking, infravision is the ability to "see" infrared light or heat. The exact game effects of infravision depend on the rules your DM is using; see pages 118 and 119 of the <strong><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></strong> for the rules governing this kind of vision. Ultravision is a bit harder to describe, but generally it is considered to be quite a bit like "starlight" optics. Creatures with ultravision have eyes that can gather large amounts of-light and can also detect ultraviolet light and use it to enhance the available normal light. Ultravision generally is useful only outdoors at night.</span>

The specialist gets <em>one</em> attack each round with the weapon in his "off" hand, regardless of level, class, or specialization.<br>&emsp;Game logic assumes that no one is coordinated enough to launch multiple attacks with each hand; there's a limit to how much activity a person's brain can direct in a single round of melee. Game balance also requires such a limitation, as warriors are not intended to be walking <em>blade barriers</em>.</span>

#165-7">🔗</a><br/><strong>How many punches can a character throw in one melee round? Does fist fighting require a weapon proficiency?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is entirely up to the DM. Contrary to popular belief, fist fighting is not universal and was unknown in several pregunpowder cultures; American Indians, for example, generally resorted to wrestling in unarmed combat, so DMs have great latitude here.<br>&emsp;I suggest allowing any character to make one attack on the punching/wrestling table (<strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 91; or <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 59) without penalty each round. Since the punching/ wrestling table allows for single-blow knockouts, I suggest that this kind of combat be treated as a special case that falls outside the normal weapons rules. However, fist fighting and wrestling <em>can</em> be treated just like any other weapons that require proficiencies. If this is the case, the proficiency should be available to any character class. If a character spends a weapon proficiency on punching, he should get the extra melee attacks listed on Table 15, <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 26, if he is a high-level warrior. Punching specialists would use Table 35, <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 52.) Any character (under any punching system) attacking with both fists would use the attacking with two-weapons rule (<strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 96). Note that wrestling generally requires two hands.</span>

#165-9">🔗</a><br/><strong>Is it acceptable for a character to <strong><em>wish</em></strong> for special abilities, such as thieving or spell-casting abilities? If granted, would these abilities be permanent or temporary? Would such a <strong><em>wish</em></strong> turn the character into something that had the desired power?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is entirely up to the DM. You've listed a couple of reasonable approaches to the problem. If wishes are fairly are in the campaign, and the DM feels that the need is justified, a special ability such as lock picking might be granted for a limited time, say as much as a month (but more likely a few turns or hours). If <strong><em>wishes</em></strong> are true rarities or if the DM really approves of high-powered player characters, it's fine to make the ability permanent, but I suggest that the ability be low powered, about one-third to one-half of what the average player character in the campaign might have. It's also a good idea to make the level of power fixed, not subject to improvement though experience. It certainly is acceptable to twist such wishes by changing the character into some creature that has the desired ability; such changes might be permanent or temporary.

Volumes I and II contain "basic" monsters, ones you'd find in just about any campaign. The remaining volumes contain creatures that are primarily associated with specific settings, such as the WORLD OF GREYHAWK® campaign or the <strong><em>Oriental Adventures</em></strong> lands. Some or all the monsters in these volumes might be found in other settings. The <strong><em>Monstrous Compendium's</em></strong> loose-leaf format is intended to allow DMs to organize the creatures in any way they see fit.</span>

How would you use ability checks or saving throws to determine if a character would be subject to such a state in the first place?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is up to the DM. The simplest way to handle this would be to have the affected character save vs. paralyzation, adjusted for wisdom. The effects of a failed save would vary with the situation, but the morale rules in the <strong><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></strong> (pages 69-72) should give you a few ideas. The RAVENLOFT™ boxed set (TSR product #1053) contains complete rules for dealing with fear and horror; see chapter 4 of the RAVENLOFT booklet.</span>

Would it allow an armored character to move at full (12) rate? Can the wearer swim?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A <strong><em>ring of free action</em></strong> protects its wearer from magical effects that hinder or immobilize, and allows the wearer to function underwater without hindrance due to water resistance. It does not negate encumbrance penalties, nor does it allow characters to ignore armor restrictions due to character class (not even thieves). It is important to note that magic in the AD&D game is specific and specialized; collateral effects, even those suggested by logic, usually do not occur. While a character wearing a <strong><em>ring of free action</em></strong> can ignore the effects of an <strong><em>entangle</em></strong> spell, the wearer is not granted the ability to freely move through underbrush as can a druid. Likewise, there is no reason to assume that the wearer cannot float or swim in water. (On the other hand, individual DMs might rule that this is the case, and thus give the character a new problem to think about while adventuring in or near the water.) The wearer of a <strong><em>ring of free action</em></strong> would be immune to attacks from a <strong><em>rope of entanglement</em></strong>, but could be physically restrained and bound with any normal rope. Note that the ring also does not empower the wearer to ignore barriers such as normal walls or a <strong><em>forcecage</em></strong> spell.</span>

Could the spell break a welded link of a massive chain holding up a bridge? Could it pop a rivet out of a battleship?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;A <strong><em>knock</em></strong> spell cannot do either of the things you have described. The spell opens closures; it does not destroy structures. If a closure that can be opened by a <strong><em>knock</em></strong> spell (doors, lids; shackles, etc.) is sealed with a weld or rivet, the spell will break the weld or rivet, provided that the closure is not larger than the spells area of effect. For example, a pair of handcuffs riveted shut <em>will</em> pop open when <strong><em>knocked</em></strong>. Note that the spell description (see the <strong><em>Player's Handbook</em></strong>, page 143) does not specifically mention rivets, but these should not be allowed to provide an easy way around <strong><em>knock</em></strong> spells. However, a single rivet is one "means of preventing egress." A single <strong><em>knock</em></strong> spell pops two rivets sealing an opening.</span>

#166-6">🔗</a><br/><strong>Does a dual-classed character receive a new set of initial proficiencies when switching to a new class?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;This is up to the DM, but I suggest not. A character's initial proficiencies reflect what he has learned during his nonadventuring career. Switching to a new class does not bring about a fresh wave of knowledge. Also, since the rules allow a character to switch classes multiple times if he qualifies (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 45), you will begin to encounter game balance problems as characters gain multiple "loads" of initial proficiencies. Dual-classed characters do, however, have to learn a new way of doing things when embarking on a new class, and should be given at least one new weapon proficiency (and one nonweapon proficiency if the campaign uses them) when starting the new class. Otherwise, the character is quite likely to be miserably unprepared to pursue his new vocation.</span>

#167-1">🔗</a><br/><strong>Are creatures that are immune to normal weapons also immune to "natural" damage such as falling? If not, how much damage equals one "plus"? Is a creature that is immune to normal weapons also immune to normal fire?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Table 48 in the <strong><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></strong> (page 69) implies that weapon immunities are not absolute. Until official word comes along, you have several options:<br>&emsp;1. You might apply Table 48 directly. That is, a fall of 50' or more can hurt a creature hit by only +1 or better weapons because it inflicts five dice of damage, and such creature can be harmed by any creature with 4 + 1 or more hit dice.<br>&emsp;2. You can assume that gravity and im- pact with the unforgiving earth are more powerful than any weapon, and allow falls of any length to harm any creature.<br>&emsp;Although some DMs rule otherwise, immunity to normal fire is a special defense all by itself. Unless a creature's description specifically lists an immunity to fire or other form of energy, it is safe to assume that the creature is vulnerable to various energy attacks, magical or not.</span>

For instance, can a dwarf with a <strong><em>vorpal short sword</em></strong> sever a storm giant's neck? What happens if the attacker gets a roll good enough to sever hut not good enough attack the target's armor class?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;If the DM rules that an attack cannot reach the neck, then the neck cannot be severed. However, there is no reason to assume that a foe's neck always is out of reach just because he is taller than the weapon wielder. During the course of a melee round, a very tall opponent might bend over to get a good swipe at his shorter opponent. Individual DMs must adjudicate these situations as they arise. A <strong><em>vorpal weapon</em></strong> or a <strong><em>weapon of sharpness</em></strong> must score a hit to sever anything. If the die roll is high enough to sever but not high enough to hit, the attack fails and nothing is severed.</span>

A wizard in my campaign has just <strong><em>charmed</em></strong> a shambling mound and has been busy dumping <strong><em>lightning bolts</em></strong> into it. When I wrote this letter, the shambling mound was up to 30 HD, and it probably will be up to 100 HD by the time you publish this. What should I do?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Gamesmanship such as you have described is fine in small doses; however, the DM must intervene when rules-bending threatens to send the campaign out of control. What should you do? Get creative.<br>&emsp;A shambling mound gains 1 HD and grows 1' with every lightning attack. Ever hear of growing pains? Anything that causes pain can be construed as a hostile act (the wizard in your example hardly has the shambler's best interests in mind), and attacks on the subject of a <strong><em>charm</em></strong> by the caster break the effect. Or, assume that the growth effect is only temporary—perhaps the shambler can maintain the extra growth for only a few turns or hours. Afterward, the shambler might shrink or the new growth might just die off. If you're feeling especially cruel, you might rule that once the shambler reaches 16 dice, it splits off and forms two 8-HD shamblers. Of course, the new shamblers wouldn't be <strong><em>charmed</em></strong>. Note that unless the wizard in your example is using the <strong><em>charm plants</em></strong> spell, communication with the <strong><em>charmed</em></strong> shambler isn't possible without a <strong><em>speak with plants</em></strong> spell.</span>

Does he simply become a generalist or is his loss more catastrophic?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The specialist suffers no ill effects at all; ability score reductions of any kind are painful enough. As this column has explained before. ability-score requirements for class and race are <em>initial</em> requirements only! Once a character becomes a member of a certain class or specialty, he stays a member unless he violates an alignment requirement or similar restriction placed on the class.</span>

Therefore, a conjurer can cast evocation spells, because he is barred only from greater divinations and invocations. Right?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Wrong. Invocation/Evocation is a single school; the "Invocation" entry in the conjurer's opposition school list is a typo. Note also that the proper name for the Greater Divination school is Lesser/Greater Divination. Conjurers are barred from learning divination spells of all kinds, not (as one reader suggested) just divination spells of 4th level and above.</span>

If the store doesn't have a club, the management probably will let you post a notice asking about clubs. When looking for a club, be ready to form your own if there isn't one in your area; it's quite likely that other gamers in your area also would like to join a club.<br>&emsp;The worlds largest role-playing club, the RPGA™ Network, has members in every region in the United States and in about 17 other countries. For more information about the RPGA Network, write: RPGA Network, P.O. Box 515, Lake Geneva WI 53147, U.S.A.

According the <strong><em>DMG</em></strong>, page 41, spells can be researched using scrolls, but not just copied.</strong><br/><span>&emsp;Page 41 gives the specific time requirements and costs for getting a spell found on a scroll into a spell book.

#168-3">🔗</a><br/><strong>How does the <strong><em>invisibility</em></strong> spell work? Does it make the recipient transparent? If so, why isn't it an alteration spell? If <strong><em>invisibility</em></strong> is illusory, who decides what a creature sees when looking through an <strong><em>invisible</em></strong> creature? (Since the subject is "removed" from the scene, something's got to replace it.) Why does attacking make the subject visible? Why doesn't the spell make objects the subject picks up disappear?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;<strong><em>Invisibility</em></strong> is illusory, and no one decides what a creature sees when gazing through an <strong><em>invisible</em></strong> creature. The recipient isn't removed; it is rendered visually undetectable. In campaigns in Lake Geneva, most people assume the spell bends light so it passes around the recipient rather than bouncing off the recipient or being blocked altogether. "Bent" light affects a creature's eyes in exactly the same way unbent light does, though very intelligent or powerful creatures have a chance to notice the bent light and get a saving throw against the effect (see the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 142). There probably are many other workable explanations of the spells mechanics; for example, the retinas of a viewing creature's eyes might be rendered completely insensitive to the recipient's image. In any case, the spells effect is strictly limited to a live recipient (the spell description lists "creature touched" as the area of effect), and the spell has absolutely no power to change the way the subject's surroundings look.<br>&emsp;If you take another look at the spell description, you'll see that items the subject picks up do become <strong><em>invisible</em></strong>. For the purposes of this spell, anything the recipient can tuck into his clothing is considered part of the recipient. Attacks break the spell because the dweomer isn't powerful enough to continue hiding the recipient from creatures under attack. The instinct for self preservation sharpens the victims' perceptions, and the spell unravels.<br>&emsp;Apparently, quite a few folks think <strong><em>invisibility</em></strong> ought to fall into the alteration school; if you are one of them, by all means go ahead and run it that way. However, one also can argue that <strong><em>invisibility</em></strong> is an enchantment because it grants the recipient the "power" to disappear—and to make objects disappear, too. <strong><em>Invisibility</em></strong> is called as an illusion because the spells primary effect is to change the way other creatures perceive the recipient (i.e., they have no visual perception of the recipient at all). As such, the spell is more akin to other perception-altering spells such as <strong><em>phantasmal force</em></strong> and <strong><em>blindness</em></strong> than to any other class of spell. (One also could argue that <strong><em>blindness</em></strong> is an alteration, since it "removes" sight, but the loss of sight is a change in the way the recipient perceives things, so the spell is classed as an illusion.)</span>

#168-4">🔗</a><br/><strong>Why can't psionicists be chaotic? After all, chaotic creatures tend to be self centered, and self knowledge is important to psionicists. Can chaotic characters have wild talents? Can a psionicist who has lost his abilities because he has become chaotic develop a wild talent?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;It is very hard to answer this question any better than <strong><em>The Complete Psionics Handbook</em></strong> already does (see page 10), but here it goes: A broad range of psionic powers can be developed only through long hours of patient and intense meditation conducted according to strict rules. Chaotic characters are too impatient to meditate and too free thinking to accept the rules; therefore they cannot become psionicists. Many chaotic creatures have natural psionic abilities, but these creatures are not psionicists <em>per se</em>. Only chaotic-evil characters are terribly self centered; chaotic neutrals tend not to care about much of anything except for spreading chaos, and chaotic-good characters generally are concerned about other individuals' basic well being and freedom from oppression. In any event, to be self centered is not the same thing as being self aware or having true self knowledge.<br>&emsp;Any character can manifest a wild talent—even a "fallen" psionicist.</span>

Would a druid who finds himself in a party of lawfulgood characters be obligated to work at cross purposes with his companions?<br>&emsp;Can a thief who is lawful good pick pockets?<br>&emsp;Could a paladin intimidate or harm a prisoner to get information? Does the prisoner's own alignment make a difference in this case?<br>&emsp;Why does the AD&D game have alignments? Why can't players just decide how their characters act rather then trying to force them into a prefabricated mold?</strong><br/><span>&emsp;The people asking these questions all seem to share the same misconceptions about alignment. If questions similar to these have occurred to you, I suggest you carefully reread the section on alignments in the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, starting on page 46. Pay special attention to the second paragraph on page 46, particularly the last sentence.<br>&emsp;Alignments in the AD&D game are the cornerstones of characters' personalities. They help each player decide what a character's attitudes and values are, but they are guidelines, not absolute rules. The game's designers and editors do not assume that the entire spectrum of morality, ethics, and philosophy can neatly be categorized into nine strict divisions, and you shouldn't either. When picking an alignment for a player character, I suggest you spend some time thinking about what the character's disposition, principles, and sentiments are; then choose an alignment that fits the character.<br>&emsp;Alignment is not defined by a single act. A good thief might indeed pick a pocket, and he might do so for any of many different reasons. He could lift a few coppers from an ostentatious fop to help feed a starving waif; he could filch the spell components from an opposing wizard during a combat encounter; or he might steal something outright, temporarily succumbing to greed (any character is entitled to commit the occasional slip). Note that, in the core AD&D 2nd Edition game, there are no lawful-good thieves (see <strong><em>PHB</em></strong>, page 38).<br>&emsp;I occasionally see a letter from a person who thinks of lawful-good characters as ruthless, heartless folk who relentlessly impress their own views on others, but that's the lawful-evil formula for living. "Good" implies altruism, kindness, and the ability to see that serving the welfare of others can promote one's own self interests. On the other hand, I get too many letters from people who think good characters, and lawful-good characters particularly, are doormats who'll always allow evil creatures take advantage of their nobler instincts. Not so. Lawful-good characters, especially paladins, usually have very definite ideas about what has to be done to promote goodness, and they are free to try all manner of things to achieve their goals. Torture usually is considered evil because helpless people are capriciously harmed; however, a lawful-good creature might very well use bluff, intimidation, or even stronger measures to get vital information from a captive in order to better protect the innocent or confound a great evil. One severe interrogation, administered at the right time and for the right reason, does not make an inquisition.<br>&emsp;I get a lot of letters from people having trouble with the druidical ethos. Druids in the AD&D game believe in a "natural order" in which good, evil, law, and chaos play equally important roles. The first two paragraphs under the "ethos" heading on page 37 of the <strong><em>PHB</em></strong> explain the major elements of druidical doctrine.<br>&emsp;Contrary to popular belief, maintaining "balance," especially on a personal scale, is not a druidical priority. According to the druidical view, there is a universal cycle that constantly shifts the cosmic balance between the eight "extreme" alignments. Even major shifts in the balance don't bother druids, since any one alignment's ascendancy is as temporary as fine summer weather. Druids are, however, on the lookout for anything that might cause the balance to "stick." In the druidical view, a universe permanently turned good or evil would either be unproductive, like a world caught in eternal summer where the harvest never comes, or sterile, like a world gripped by endless winter. However, most parties' actions are insignificant when measured on a universal scale. Even heroic adventurers don't often get the chance the affect the whole cosmos, and very few mortals ever get the opportunity to affect the balance in a way that would concern a druid.<br>&emsp;Druids do not deliberately change their actions to reflect first one alignment, then another. Such shifts would make a druid's actions totally unpredictable, which in turn would tend to promote chaos. Druids believe that each of the eight alignments is equally valid, so it doesn't much matter to a druid which alignment his recent behavior tends to favor; any alignment will do over the short run. Druids do tend to be nonjudgemental about good, evil, law, and chaos; and they try to remain flexible and uncommitted to any single moral, legal, or philosophical system. However, druids regard interalignment struggles as part of nature, and druids serve nature. Since druids regard conflict between alignments as necessary, they do not seek to prevent their parties from continuing the struggle, nor do they resent being pulled into it themselves. Staying completely aloof or blocking their companions involvement would be as "unnatural" as trying to keep the leaves from falling in the autumn. Also, druids aren't stupid. Most parties won't take kindly to having their efforts continually stymied by a contrary druid (remember, alignment does not make characters into doormats). Being nonjudgmental, druids tend to go along with whatever their party chooses to do unless the party's actions threaten trees, crops, wild plants, and other things the druid is pledged to protect.</span>
