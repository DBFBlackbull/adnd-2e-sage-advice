                `The spells do always hit, after a fashion. In the case of a ***fireball***, the missile bursts at the designated range unless it strikes an object before it gets there. Since the missile flies in a straight line between the caster and the target, it can be blocked by invisible barriers (such as ***walls of force***) or by a bend in a passage obscured by an illusion or mirror.`,
                `A ***lightning bolt*** is similar to a ***fireball*** in that the spell begins at a designated height and range, extending directly away from the caster. A ***lightning bolt*** is always either 40' or 80' long, and the caster must decide which when he casts the spell. If caster miscalculates and casts this spell into an area too small to contain it, the lightning bolt grows to its full length (as measured from the point where it strikes a barrier), heading back at the caster unless it smashes through the barrier (see page 151). Some readers have misread the example on page 151; ***lightning bolts*** do not bend or fold over when hitting a barrier. The 80' bolt in the example starts 40' away from the caster, travels 10', and strikes a barrier; the bolt must maintain its full length, however, so the opposite end of the bolt (starting from the point of origin) instantly grows out in the direction toward the spell-caster, extending 70' from its point of origin. Thus, the bolt's final length is SO'. A victim caught between the point of origin and the wall behind him is not struck twice by the bolt. The use of the word rebound in the spell's description seems to be the confusing element.`

                `A maul is a warhammer; see the Weapons Table on pages 68-69. Lassos and nets are not part of the 2nd Edition game and were mentioned in error. However, a typical war net is made from woven hemp cords and has small lead weights sewn into the edges. It is 5' across, weighs 6 lbs., and costs 12 sp. It takes two hands and 6' of clear space to throw a net, and the effective range is 30'. Any target hit by the net must save vs. breath weapon or become entangled. Entangled victims cannot fight or move, and defend at -2. Entangled victims wriggle free if they make a successful wrestling attack vs. AC 2; they can make one attempt to get free each round. When used as a melee weapon, treat a net as a scourge. A lasso is simply a rope with an adjustable loop. A successful hit with a lasso puts the loop around part of the target creature's body, but this does not necessarily immobilize the creature; the DM has to decide where the loop is (around the neck, a limb, the upper body, etc.) and assess the appropriate penalty. Since the lasso's wielder can pull the loop tight, the only way to escape, short of killing the wielder or getting the rope away from him, is to cut or break the rope.`

            question: `Why haven't you answered my 27 letters, each with 57 questions on my favorite game system? You said you would reply if I sent an SASE with each letter. Why don't you give a seminar at the GEN CON® game fair? If I come to Lake Geneva, can I meet you and ask you questions?`,
            answer: [
                `Although the "Sage Advice" in DRAGON issue #121 said the sage would make personal replies, I receive so many letters that I cannot answer every one. (However, if you don't enclose an SASE, I cannot reply at all.) Usually I reply only to letters that have questions I can use in the column, so that all the readers get the benefit of my time. Needless to say, I don't give extended private interviews in Lake Geneva or anywhere else.`,
                `If you want to increase your chances of getting a personal reply, do the following:`,
                `1. Look through your books for your answers, and be sure to consult the indexes (if the books have them). Often, with a little extra effort, you'll find rules that have eluded you.`,
                `2. Keep your letter short. Decide what you really need to know, and stick to the most important questions. As I've stressed before, role-playing games involve choices and decisions; don't be afraid to make some on your own.`,
                `3. Include the title of the book and the page number that contains the rule you are asking about; this saves me a lot of page flipping.`,
                `My work with the RPGA™ Network keeps me busy at almost every game convention I attend, and seminars are not the best place to answer rules questions. I'm not an encyclopedia of game knowledge. I rely on a big library and a large network of personal contacts to find answers, and few people would be entertained by watching me flip through my books and consult my files while I struggle with a tricky question. Still, I do answer some questions at conventions; just keep them short, and don't interrupt me while I'm running a game. Also, some conventions I attend collect written questions for me so that I can use them in the column or work on them during the show and discuss the results with anyone who is interested.`,

            question: `What is the proper way to handle a fight with a hydra? Does the creature's effective hit dice drop as it loses heads? Will damage to the creature's body kill it? How do area-effect spells such as ***fireball*** effect the heads? How does one determine when a lernaean hydra's regeneration ability is stopped?`,
            answer: [
                `Hydras do pose a few problems, especially when magic is involved. I suggest the following rules for handling combat with a hydra.`,
                `A hydra's effective hit dice do not drop as the creature loses heads. With respect to melee, each of a hydra's heads is treated as a separate creature. Each head dies when it reaches zero hit points, and excess damage does not carry over to another head. When all heads are reduced to zero hit points, the creature dies immediately. Hits to a hydra's body will kill it; the body has as many hit points as the total hit points of its starting heads. When the body is reduced to zero hit points, however, the creature continues to fight as long as it has at least one living head. It will then fight for an additional 2-8 rounds or until the body is reduced to -20 hp.`,
                `A lernaean hydra's regeneration ability makes it a tougher nut to crack. The individual heads can be slain in the normal manner; however, a fire source must be applied to each slain head or it will regenerate. ***Burning hands*** is the easiest way to scorch the stumps or sundered heads. A torch, flask of oil,. or ***flame tongue*** sword will stop a single head's regeneration if applied in time. Any successful hit on the slain head will stop regeneration. A lernaean hydra stays alive as long as it has one living or regenerating head (hits to the creature's body not withstanding).`,
                `When any hydra is affected by an area spell such as ***fireball*** or ***lightning bolt***, the heads are treated as a single entities, with the damage distributed as evenly as possible among the heads. Although the heads are separate melee targets, they are still part of the same creature. The creature's body suffers as much damage as the heads took in total (i.e., the hydra gets one saving throw, but the heads and the body each take damage).`,
                `Spells that can kill a creature outright such as ***death spell***, ***power word kill***, or ***disintegrate*** kill the creature only if it fails its saving throw (if applicable). When determining a hydra's resistance to such spells, its effective hit dice are equal to its starting number of heads (or peak number, in the case of a lernaean hydra), and its effective hit points are equal to the total hit points of all the heads (damage to the body notwithstanding).`,
                `A spell that affects one creature or a limited area (such as ***magic missile*** or ***burning hands***) must be directed either at the body or at one or more heads of the hydra, according to the limitations of the spell. Spells such as ***charm monster***, ***hold monster***; or ***slow*** affect the entire creature, as the beast effectively has only one brain—perhaps at the base of the necks inside the body.`

            question: `What happens if a magic-user uses a sword when in desperate need?`,
            answer: [
                `If a character's need is truly great, the DM can allow any class of character to use a weapon prohibited to his class. The normal nonproficiency penalty applies (perhaps with an additional - 1 to hit). If a player falls into the habit of declaring his characters in desperate need too often, however, the DM should either disallow the use of the prohibited weapon or give the character no experience award for completing the adventure.`

Deafness can cause spells with verbal components to be miscast and fail. The failure chance is up to you, but it shouldn't exceed 20% (less for spells with short casting times). The cleric spell ***holy word*** has a deafness effect that causes spells to fail 50% of the time; this is due mostly to the extreme power of the holy word, not merely the deafness.`

            question: `What is the significance of weapon speed factors?`,
            answer: [
                `Weapon speed factors allow for comparison among weapons. The lower the speed factor, the quicker the weapon. Their most common use (and the only use mentioned in the rules) is for breaking ties on initiative. When a tie occurs, compare weapon speed factors; the lowest factor goes first. However, on the first round of a melee, when the opponents are closing, the longer weapons have the advantage. The advantage is also with mounted opponents attacking or defending against unmounted opponents and with characters who are defending or attacking from above. Spellcasting time is equivalent to the weapon speed factor. That is, a weapon with a speed factor of 3 is as slow as a three-segment spell for purposes of tie breaking.`

            question: `How do you use the weapon to-hit adjustment tables in the ***Players Handbook*** (page 38) and ***Unearthed Arcana*** (page 27)? I don't understand what they mean.`,
            answer: [
                `The tables list the bonus or penalty given to a weapon against the basic armor types. For example, the line for Axe, Hand reads: -5, -4, -3, etc., for AC 0, AC 1, AC 2, etc., respectively. Full plate armor and shield gives AC 0, so a hand axe has a -5 to hit vs. full plate armor and shield. If the target were wearing full plate armor + 1 and using no shield, the adjustment is still AC 0. However, full plate armor alone is AC 1, so you use the AC 1 column regardless of magical bonuses, and the hand axe has a -4 to hit. The same holds true for dexterity bonuses. These tables are for attacking humans, demi-humans, and humanoids—never for attacking monsters. Use of the tables is strictly optional; they were included in the game mainly to satisfy the real history buffs who know that certain weapons were much more effective than others on the medieval battlefield.`

The weapons depicted on these pages include everything on your list except the scimitar. A scimitar is simply a curved broad sword used by Arabs and Saracens.

            answer: [
                `You were correct. Pole arms are not intended to be thrown, no matter what the thrower's strength. Anything, however, can be thrown with some chance of success. For throwing a pole arm, we suggest a to-hit penalty of -4 at short range (10' or less), -6 at medium range (11-20'), and -9 at long range (21-30'). We also suggest that you use these ranges outdoors where other missiles have ranges measured in yards. A pole arm is far too long for a human-sized creature to throw like a hand axe (so that the weapon spins or tumbles), no matter how much strength is available. Spear-type throws are possible, but hits can inflict damage only if the pole arm that is thrown has a spear point. Use spear damage (1-6) in this case, not pole-arm damage.`

For example, a fighter must be standing in a space at least 4' wide to use a battle axe. Space requirements are cumulative; therefore, two fighters using battle axes side-by-side would require 8' of space.`

            answer: [
                `In medical terms, paralyzation is the loss of sensation in part of the body as the victim's brain, for one reason or another, no longer controls the body. The uncontrolled muscles relax, and the victim goes limp. Autonomic muscles, such as the heart and lungs, are unaffected. Some kinds of paralysis in the AD&D game (paralysis caused by ghouls and ghasts, for example) cause the victim to become rigid and immobile. In either case, paralysis affects only the body, not the mind. The victim can still think and use psionics or any form of movement that does not require muscular effort. For example, if a character becomes paralyzed while using a ***fly*** spell, he can still fly until the spell runs out.`,
                `Paralyzation is not permanent. It can last anywhere from several rounds or turns to as much as a day. It can be removed with a ***remove paralysis*** spell (which removes paralysis of all types) or by a ***cure disease***, ***neutralize poison***, or ***dispel magic*** spell, depending on what caused the paralysis. Paralysis caused by undead creatures is disease- or fear-based; paralysis caused by living creatures is poison-based; paralysis caused by a ***glyph of warding*** or the illusionist spell ***paralyzation*** is magic-based. The AD&D 2nd Edition ***Monstrous Compendium***, Volume 1, lists the duration for ghoul paralysis as 3-8 rounds and ghast paralysis as 5-10 rounds. Paralysis caused by more powerful creatures lasts longer; lich paralysis, for example, lasts until dispelled.`

                `The character firing the missile declares which creature he is targeting. (Any of the character's allies who are fighting with the target creatures are potential targets for the missile.) Randomly determine which target will actually be in the path of the missile. If the figures in the melee are about the same size (e.g., human vs. hu- man, elf vs. dwarf), there is an equal chance that either the enemy or an ally could be the missile's actual target. If the die roll indicates that an ally will be the actual target and there are multiple allies fighting the intended target, randomly determine which ally is the actual target.`,
                `Roll the to-hit number. If the appropriate number for the target's armor class is rolled, then the target is hit whether or not the character firing the missile wanted to hit that target. If the creatures in the melee are of different sizes, the larger creatures are more likely to be hit. I sug- gest a two-thirds chance (1-4 on 1d61 to hit the larger target when the height difference is 2-3' (ignore height differences of less than 2'). If the height difference is more than 3', allow the missile to hit the larger target automatically if the firer wishes; otherwise, the chance to hit the larger target is 5 in 6.`,

Some DMs may rule that if an entire party is surprised, all must save against the gaze during the first surprise segment of the encounter (several party members could accidentally meet the creature's gaze during the confusion of the surprise segment).`

The player's single attack roll represents the result of a series of attacks by the character, not just a Single blow. See the ***DMG***, page 61, for more details.

It has the chance of a large and hard object to stun, and does normal sap damage (1-2) when a stun is scored. A sap is a weapon and negates the initiative penalty for pummeling attacks.

Bushi-ninja do get strength bonuses. Any ninja can use the skills, spells, and ki powers of his other class within the restrictions given (e.g., a wu jen-ninja cannot cast spells while wearing armor).

Gold, electrum, and platinum are not accepted as currency in Kara-Tur, so these coins must be sold for the market value of the metal in them. The market value of one gold piece is 2-7 (1d6 + 1) tael (see page 38). Extrapolating, a platinum piece is worth 11-30 (1d20 + 20) tael. The market price of gold and platinum varies independently, so it is possible for the price of platinum to be low while the price of gold is high.

                `Items in the possession of the spellcaster are immune to the spell's effects. Items in the possession of other creatures gain their possessors' saving throws vs. spells, with all adjustments. Items that are by themselves can be ***disjoined*** using the ***dispel magic*** spell's system (comparing the caster's level vs. the level at which the magical item was created).

            question: `How do you determine the effect of a ***sleep*** spell on a group of mixed creature types?`,
            answer: [
                `This is up to the DM. He may rule that weaker creatures are affected first, or he may allow the caster to choose whether the more powerful creatures or the weaker creatures are affected first. He may also rule that creatures closest to the center of the spell's area of effect are affected first. The DM can choose any of these methods as long as he uses the same method all of the time.`,
                `If weaker creatures are affected first, the DM should roll to see how many of them are put to sleep and apply the effects. If all of the weaker creatures were put to sleep by the spell, and if the number of potential victims rolled was greater than the number actually affected, the DM may then take half of that difference (dropping fractions) and apply that to the next most powerful group of victims. For example, a magic-user faces a group of six 1—1-HD creatures, two 1-HD creatures, and one 3-HD creature. The DM rolls 4d4 and gets a 10. The six 1—1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving a difference of 4. Half of 4 is two, so the two 1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving the 3-HD creature unaffected., In another example, the magic-user faces four 1-HD creatures and one 4 + 1-HD creature. The DM rolls 2d4 and gets a 5. Four 1-HD creatures fall asleep; the difference is 1, but nothing remains after 1 is reduced by half and all fractions are dropped. Even if the result of the 2d4 roll had been an 8, the 4 + 1-HD creature would not be affected (8 - 4 = 4, 1⁄2 x 4 = 2, but no monsters were present in the 2 + 1 to 3-HD category). The PC should not have everything his own way!`

            question: `How does an ***anti-magic shell*** work? Does it destroy any spell with which it comes in contact? Can the caster cast spells through the ***anti-magic shell***?`,
            answer: [
                `An ***anti-magic shell*** negates all magic within its area of effect. The caster's spells (which originate within the shell) are also negated, although they may remain after the shell's duration expires if their own durations are long enough. Note also that the shell causes magical items within its area of effect to cease functioning. In any case, the shell does not function like a ***dispel magic*** spell. Magical items are not destroyed by the shell; they merely cease to function while within it. If their duration permits, magical effects will still function when they are taken away from the shell or when the shell's duration expires. For example, a ***continual light*** spell cast upon a rock will be negated only as long as that rock is within the shell; the ***continual light*** spell functions normally afterward. If part of a magical effect's area extends into the shell, only the portion within the shell is negated; the effect functions normally outside the shell. However, if a spell with an instantaneous duration is cast so that its center is within the radius of the shell, the spell is *completely* negated. For example, if a ***fireball*** were cast so that it would detonate inside an ***anti-magic shell***, there would be no effect. If a ***fireball*** were cast so that it would detonate outside the ***shell***, however, only the portion of the ***fireball*** crossing into the shell would be negated.`

(Of course, if the spell were cast at a deity-class creature, it might produce such opponents.) If the spell is cast against an orc, it's likely to produce a hobgoblin or a gnoll at most.

When the magic-user reaches 2nd level, he can cast two first-level spells, and he gains an additional first-level spell for his book.

            question: `After purchasing the first two volumes of the ***Monstrous Compendium***, I cannot help but have the sneaking suspicion that devils and demons are not going to appear in any of the new monster tomes. I, for one, would be disappointed if these most villainous of villains are to be excluded from the AD&D game. In short, are devils and demons going to appear in any AD&D 2nd Edition reference books, or has society reared its ugly head once more to thwart creativity and enjoyment?`,
            answer: [
                `The answer, in short, is at present there are no plans to include devils, demons, and similar creatures in the AD&D 2nd Edition game. Society has not reared its "ugly head." In fact, society is the source of creativity and enjoyment—gamers, game producers, and game columnists are part of society. Society as a whole is not down on gamers; some people I know who make it a hobby to study the anti-role-playing movement tell me the whole brouhaha is the work of less than a dozen people, most of them in the United States, who were well known for their questionable religious dogmas long before the D&D® and AD&D games came on the scene. No major religious sect or denomination officially opposes the D&D game or any other role-playing game. These few individuals have been able to fool a lot of people into believing their propaganda by pointing to a few items in the old AD&D game books and saying, "This is a satanic game." The unsuspecting public, being uninformed about role-playing and disinclined to actually read the books themselves, started buying this vituperation.`,
                `The demons and devils in the old ***Monster Manuals*** were a prime weapon in the campaign of misinformation directed against gaming, so they were dropped from the new edition. It's possible that demons and devils will be revised into a format that preserves their usefulness in adventure design and does not give the game's detractors cheap ammunition, but that format hasn't been found yet. In the meantime, the revamped dragons and giants—which have been given a tremendous boost in the ***Monstrous Compendium***—should do a nice job of filling the role of ultimate adversary.`

            question: `There seem to be several problems with the new dragon descriptions. Does the combat modifier really apply to both attack and damage rolls? If so, how can a really big dragon ever miss? How much damage do black dragons really do with their breath weapons? What does the "MT" column mean on the black dragon's statistics table? Why are separate body and tail lengths given for each dragon type? What is the correct tail length entry for great wyrm bronze dragons? How many times can a dragon use its breath weapon each day? The text on dragons seems to imply that dragons have no limit on how often they can use breath weapons, but the dragon turtle's description strongly implies that the limit is three times per day.`,
            answer: [
                `A dragon's combat modifier applies only to its damage rolls; the reference to attack rolls is left over from an earlier version of the manuscript. From age category five on, one digit has been dropped from the black dragon's breath weapon rating; starting from age category one, the column should read: 2d4+1, 4d4+2, 6d4+3, 8d4+4, 10d4+5, 12d4+6, 14d4+7, 16d4+8, 18d4+9, 20d4+10, 22d4+11, and 24d4+12. The "MT" is a typo; it should read "MR" for magic resistance. Only a dragon's body length is considered when calculating a dragon's size rating, since the tail is very thin. Also, damage to a dragon's tail does not really harm the dragon; only hits on the body and wings are telling enough to reduce the dragon's hit points. This makes dragons a little less vulnerable to mob tactics. A great wyrm bronze dragon's tail is 100-110' long. In the core AD&D 2nd Edition rules, a dragon can use its breath weapon three times a day, once every three rounds. To make fighting dragons less of a certain thing, however, I suggest you make the interval between breath weapons variable (roll 1d3 for the number of interval rounds). An alternate method for determining the number of a dragon's breath weapons used each day is discussed in "The New Ecology of the Dragons," in DRAGON issue #146.`

                `This was the subject of heated discussion during the game's production. Ultimately, the winning argument had two points. First, dragon breath is not magical fire; the flame produced inside a dragon is not the same as the fire in a ***fireball*** or ***wall of fire*** spell. Second, making fire giants immune to fire would imbalance the game because so many attack spells are based on fire. Still, there are plenty of nonfiery attack spells, so your campaign isn't likely to suffer if you decide to make your fire giants completely fire resistant.`

A zombie, however, is a creature (even if it is biologically dead). In the AD&D® 1st Edition rules, a mage who ***enlarged*** a corpse and cast ***permanency*** on it would have only a 5% chance to lose point of constitution (see the 1st Edition ***DMG***, page 46), because he was working with an object.

What would be the range if they were launched singly? Would the ranges for other draconians be similar?`,
            answer: [
                `**Catapulted draconians:** Light catapults hurl rocks that weigh 8-10 lbs. Heavy catapults hurl rocks that weigh 20-25 lbs. Even a single draconian of any species placed on a catapult would overload the machine so much that the catapult wouldn't fire at all. Trebuchets, however, have a much larger load capacity, hurling rocks that weigh about 500 lbs., which is probably about right for three draconians. Rocks, however, are a bit more aerodynamic than any three wingless draconians tied together, so a draconian-firing trebuchet's range should be halved, for a maxi- mum range of 240 yards and a minimum of 120 yards.`,

            answer: [
                `**Wormy PC:** Characters retain their hit points and intellect when subjected to ***polymorphing***, so your character should have been the worlds smartest and toughest worm, at least until he failed an intelligence check and assumed a worm's mentality (if a worm can be said to have a mentality). Your character would be dead if chopped in half while still mentally a "person" If the character reverted to worm mentality before being cut in half, it still would be one tough worm (having your PC's hit points), but it might very well survive being chopped in half if anyone were persistent enough to actually do it. Many DMs, however, would rule that the ***polymorph*** spell could no longer be dispelled once the change in personality took place. If the magic on either or both halves of the worm were dispelled, you'd have one or two halves of a dead character.

            answer: [
                `**Legless gnome:** The character carrying the gnome is going to be encumbered, even if he can handle the weight, because of the gnome's bulk. This means he'll suffer at least a -1 penalty to his to-hit rolls (see the 2nd Edition ***Player's Handbook***, page 79); the penalty will be worse if the gnome weighs enough to reduce the carrier's movement. The DM might also add an initiative penalty equal to the combat penalty. The gnome could fight if his arms were free. I suggest a -4 penalty to his to-hit roll and a +3 penalty to his initiative.`,

            question: `If a ***bastard sword +6***, defender was trampled by a triceratops, and the roll on the item saving-throw table was a 1 on 1d20, would the item fail because the roll was a 1 or would it make the save because it needs a 6 to save and its pluses make up the difference? If the sword did break, could it be remade with all its pluses? Would a ***wish*** completely restore the broken sword?`,
            answer: [
                `**Dinosaur vs. magical item:** In either edition of the AD&D game, a roll of 1 always fails a saving throw, weapons' bonuses notwithstanding. Someone is bound to write to me and point out that the item saving-throw table in the 1st Edition ***DMG***, page 80, lists the numbers 1 and 0 in several places. When an item has a saving throw of 1, a roll of 1 still fails; however, if the DM assigns a circumstantial penalty, any adjusted roll of 1 or more is a successful save. For example, a book falling 15' onto a hard surface has a modifier of -2 (-1 for every 5' beyond the first 5'1; if a 3 were rolled as a save, the save would be successful (3 - 2 = 1, still good). Items that have a save of 0 are immune to the listed attack form; for example, liquids are immune to blows, even if their containers are not.`,
                `A ***wish*** certainly could restore the sword if all its pieces were present. Whether or not the sword could simply be remade is up to the DM. I suggest that most enchanted items be rendered nonmagical if broken, though I can think of one or two classic fantasy stories in which broken magical items were remade. If the item is very powerful (with a bonus of +4 or better), it might be remade if it is simply broken—not ***disintegrated*** or reduced to ash or slag—and if it rolls a second save of 20. The item should get a bonus of +1 for every two magical bonuses the item has (artifacts receive a +4 bonus to their saves). If the item fails the second save, it no longer radiates magic; characters smart enough to use ***detect magic*** will know an attempt to repair the item is a waste of time. If the save is successful, the repair should be made using the best possible materials and a master craftsman of unequaled skill; finding either of these should be an adventure in itself. If the DM really wants to prolong the player's agony, he can require the being who will repair the item to make a successful proficiency check and maybe even make a save vs. spells to be successful.`,

Under certain circumstances, a ***ring of regeneration*** can restore the—ahem—physical aspects of a lady's maidenhood. A ***ring of regeneration*** can restore any damage or appendage loss if it occurs while the ring is worn.

A ***Mordenkainen's disjunction*** spell can destroy ***simulacrums*** just as it can destroy magical items; the creature's chance to resist the ***disjunction*** is based on its creator's level (or on level 14, if the creator's level is unknown).`,

For example, a ***simulacrum*** of a character might lack the original's zest for apple cider, lack an unusual nonweapon proficiency, and lack the original's distaste for undercooked meat.

The maximum spells per level rule is optional. If your campaign uses it, the character's spell limit increases along with his intelligence. If the character manages to learn a new spell and write it into his book while his intelligence score is temporarily raised, it stays there even if his intelligence subsequently drops. Intelligence losses of any kind do not affect spell books.

                `Unless there is some outside force preventing it (see the ***PHB***, page 172), a character can ***teleport*** from anywhere. Particularly strict DMs might rule that any momentum the ***teleporting*** character has will carry over after the ***teleport*** is complete. For example, if a wizard ***teleports*** out of a runaway mine car, he still might be in for a whopping impact at his destination. Unless the DM decides that the magic needed to keep a cloud castle aloft blocks ***teleportation***, it is possible to ***teleport*** to that castle. Motion is not a factor in determining what constitutes a viable destination for a teleport spell. In a sun-centered solar system, every piece of a planet's surface constantly undergoes complex motions as the planet rotates, revolves around its star, and hurtles through space with the rest of the system (not to mention any tectonic motions in the planet's crust). Nevertheless, one can ***teleport*** to any place on the planet. The key word is "place." A piece of ground, an asteroid, and a castle are all places and thus can be the destinations of a ***teleport*** spell even if they are in motion. Any other place that can provide a substantial surface as required in the spell description will also serve. Stability goes hand in hand with substance in this case; a constantly changing surface such as a flowing stream, patch of quicksand, or heaving ship's deck cannot be a destination for a ***teleport*** spell. Note that carts, wagons, ships, and other conveyances are objects, not "places." A character can ***teleport*** from such locations, but not to them.`,

Other rolls indicate juveniles with penalties to hit points, attack rolls, and damage done equal to the die roll. Juveniles in the -3 category also do one less die of damage per blow.

A -3 hill giant has -3 hp/HD, a THAC0 of 12, does 1d6 -3 hp damage with its fist or 1d6 +4 with a club. Juveniles can hurl rocks; their minimum range is the same as an adult's, and the maximum range is equal to the adult maximum minus a value equal to 10 yards times the juvenile's combat penalty; the combat penalty also is subtracted from each die of damage that the rock does (minimum of 1 hp/damage die).

                `A character with ***spellfire*** powers never actually leaves his original class. However, to gain experience in his original class, the character must refrain from using any ***spellfire*** abilities during an adventure. If the character does use a ***spellfire*** ability, all experience earned during that adven- ture goes toward the character's ***spellfire*** level, except for individual experience awards for the character's original class (see the ***DMG***, page 48), which are lost.`,
                `***Spellfire*** wielders can absorb magical energy from almost any source: spells of all types, breath weapons, gaze attacks, and just about anything else. At the 1st level of ***spellfire*** ability, absorption is involuntary; the character drains any magic with which he comes in contact, including useful magical items and healing spells (only rest or nonmagical healing can heal damage to the character). Absorption is strictly voluntary at 2nd level and above.`,
                `Exactly what happens if the character exceeds his limit is unrevealed. I suggest that either the character becomes unable to absorb more energy once he reaches the limit and consequentially is affected normally by any magic with which he comes in contact while "full," or he absorbs the excess and automatically releases one level of energy each segment (10 times per round), suffering 1-6 hp damage each time, until his total energy falls back into the "10 x constitution" category.`,

Why can't [my favorite race] become [my favorite class], since [several dozen good reasons why this race/class combination is justified exist]?`,
            answer: [
                `Game logic and game balance require that demihumans have limited character-class options. According to game logic, halflings don't become rangers because they aren't inclined to be. Halflings who really like the outdoors and nature become druids. Halflings who are nimble and good at hiding become thieves; that's just the way halflings are. Gnomes who feel roguish become thieves themselves. Those who tend toward flashy expositions become illusionists. (Illusionists, by the way, have an almost infinite capacity for vivid storytelling and practical jokes, as even a quick look at the spells in the illusion/ phantasm spell school will show.)`,
                `Only humans have the ability to become any class they want to be (ability scores permitting), and they can advance all the way to level 20. That's what makes humans unique. Demihumans have completely different psychological, physical, and spiritual makeups from humans; that's what makes each demihuman race unique. Overall, demihumans are not nearly so versatile or adaptable as are humans, because all have special skills and limitations derived from their heredity and culture that simply close some doors to them when they seek professions. Game balance requires that each race in the game be equally playable. If demihumans—with their infravision, special resistances, and special abilities—could freely choose from every character class in the game, there wouldn't be much reason to play a human character. As I've said before, the D&D® and AD&D games are games of choices; to get something, you've got to give up something else. Good players make the right choices most of the time and know how to capitalize on their characters' strengths while finding ways to circumvent their weaknesses. While changing the rules to eliminate character weaknesses is one way to circumvent them, it isn't a clever or heroic one.`

When overlapping the maps, I suggest putting the ***Kara-Tur*** map on top, as the mountains east of Solon really are there. Individual DMs will have to decide where the Dust Desert really ends—the edges would vary with the annual weather anyhow.

For example, any large and prosperous shipwrights' guild would have a library with volumes on ship design and construction, carpentry, forestry, logging, blacksmithing, rope making, weaving, sewing, and a host of other subjects, both practical and esoteric, related to shipbuilding. Members would use the library as a resource for training new members and for answering difficult or unforeseen questions that might come up during day-to-day business. The guild also would jealously guard its library to prevent competitors in other cities from learning its professional secrets and to prevent those people who are not guild members—like adventurers—from learning how to build their own ships and putting dues-paying guild members out of work.

            question: `I could not believe my eyes when I read your answer to the question about the cost of chain mail in issue #158. I, too, thought the prices had been misprinted. Your response that scale mail costs more to make than chain mail is idiotic and grossly unhistorical. Chain mail is made of wire (itself difficult and expensive to make) that is formed into links that are interlocked, then soldered or welded together. In the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., a Roman armorer, using techniques that remained essentially unchanged throughout the Middle Ages, could make four or five suits of chain mail a year. By contrast, scale mail uses metal plates—not wire—that are simply sewn onto a leather shirt.`,
            answer: [
                `To reiterate, the base cost of chain mail in the AD&D 2nd Edition game is 75 gp, and the base cost of scale mail is 120 gp. Itemized breakdowns of the costs of manufacture for each type of armor are given on page 6 of the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***. Your estimate of the construction time for chain mail agrees with the table in the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***, where an unsupervised apprentice working in a properly equipped shop can make a suit of chain mail in 10 weeks (5.2 suits a year). However, *two* apprentices working under the same conditions take eight weeks to make a suit of scale mail (16 man-weeks in all). Scale mail requires more raw materials (60 gp worth) than does chain mail (38 gp worth); chain mail's rings require less labor and metal than scale mail's plates.`,
                `Note, however, that chain mail and scale mail come from two different historical periods. (See the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 35, for a discussion of time periods in the AD&D game and their associated technology.) Scale mail, an ancient armor type, had all but disappeared by the time chain mail came into common use during the Middle Ages. Obviously, if you have a campaign set right on the borderline between the end of the Ancient period (when the ***DMG*** says chain mail doesn't exist at all) and the beginnings of the Dark Ages, about 1100 A.D. or so, chain mail is going to be very expensive. There are several reasons for this. First, chain mail would represent the newest and best concept in body armor—keeping up with the latest developments is always costly. Second, the manufacturing techniques and advanced metallurgy that made chain mail economical to manufacture during the Middle Ages would not yet have been invented. Third, from a campaign standpoint, chain mail *should* be more expensive than scale mail; you can kiss your play balance goodbye if the best armor available isn't also the most costly. You are free to set your own cost for chain mail in such a setting, but I recommend at least double (150 gp) and triple (225 gp) normal prices would not be unreasonable. Furthermore, chain mail in this setting probably would be made of iron, not steel, as the equipment list in the ***Player's Handbook*** assumes. Such chain mail would weigh 50 lbs. instead of the listed 40 lbs., or 25% more (see ***DMG***, page 38).`,
                `Speaking of the "unhistorical": One does not have to have wire to make chain mail. The Romans used rings cut, punched, or drilled from sheets of metal. The Romans and ancient Chinese probably also had access to cast rings. Wire was pretty rare in medieval Europe, and most wire was gold, silver, or copper for use in jewelry and adornments. Medieval armorers almost certainly made their chain mail from rods that they forged themselves from ingots or bars; this is not as difficult as it sounds, especially when the armorer knew what he was doing and had his whole life to practice the skill. (Note that making a rod from a chunk of raw metal takes a lot less hammering than what would be required to make a flat plate out of the same piece of metal.) Furthermore, the chain mail currently preserved in museums and private collections is not soldered or welded, but riveted; in most cases, however, the rivets were hammered so carefully that the links *appear* to be welded. Finally, not all chain mail had its links fastened. Ancient armorers often simply linked the rings, as did their successors when they were in a hurry or wanted to cut costs. This generally made inferior armor, but Oriental armorers often made very good unriveted chain mail (as good as riveted mail) by using a superior alloy and by making each ring from two or three coils of rod.`,
                `For readers who are interested in learning more about the manufacture of chain mail and other types of armor, I recommend ***A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor***, by George Cameron Stone. The book is uncommon but is available at better used book stores and at large libraries.`,

            question: `To answer your question in issue #156 (page 55, third column): Yes, those questions do arise during play. Now that you know this, perhaps you'd reconsider your answer to the "watery ranger" question. Where I'm from, characters get wished into glasses of water all the time (the idea originated in a fanzine), and your suggestion that such characters can be killed simply by drinking them is tough on PCs.`,
            answer: [
                `First, if ***wishes*** are so common in your campaigns that they are used for anything "all the time," you've got too many ***wishes*** floating around; cut back. Note that a ***wish*** is the only magic in the core AD&D rules that can turn a character into a glass of water. ***Polymorph any object*** can turn organic matter into inorganic matter, but into only one kind of matter at a time; a successful spell could turn a character into a glass, or into water, but not both.`,
                `Second, ***wishes*** are *not* intended to be used as direct attacks on creatures. Such ***wishes*** fall into the grossly unfair category (see ***PHB***, page 197), and the DM should actively subvert the intent of such spells whenever they are used, even when they are used by NPCs. Thus, if an evil wizard ***wishes*** a PC "into a glass of water." a huge glass containing the PC and many gallons of water should appear; rest assured that at least one novel twist exists for each possible wording of this ***wish***.`,
                `Third, this ***wish*** should allow a saving throw, since it is being used as a high-powered ***polymorph any object*** spell.`,
                `Fourth, any ***polymorphed*** character retains his hit points. Drinking the character will cause harm just as surely as eating the character would, but if the character has 100 hp, drinking the character is going to be a long and difficult process. Water in a glass has no armor class (it just sits there), but the most damage a human can do by drinking is 1-2 hp per round. Note that big, nasty teeth have no real effect on water, but a large tongue does, so a dragon or cow might be able to "drink" 1-12 hp each round. Also, as TSR editor Jon Pickens points out, if a character is turned into a *glass* of water, a few of his hit points will be held in the glass (say 10-20% of the total), and the glass must be smashed before the character can be killed; this, too, is easier said than done if the victim has a lot of hit points.`,
                `Finally, although evaporation or spillage can "kill" the character, death won't be instantaneous. An evaporated character is effectively in gaseous form until his molecules are thoroughly dispersed in the atmosphere; a kind DM might rule that the gaseous state lasts indefinitely. Similarly, a watery character poured into the dirt and allowed to soak in can be considered melded into stone and not truly dead.`

            question: `One of my characters was recently tricked into donning a ***girdle of femininity/masculinity***. What options do I have for getting the character back to normal? If the character finds another such girdle and puts it on, will this change him back? My DM says this won't work because the item's description says a ***wish*** has only a 50% chance of restoring the character's original sex.

If the character dons a second girdle, he might have his gender restored, or he might lose all gender—and your DM might rule that this is more likely than the standard 10% chance (***DMG***, page 170), since the character is fiddling around with things best left alone.

Individual DMs are free to include the ability to change gender along with form, but players shouldn't count on it without consulting the DM. Furthermore, assuming that your DM does allow ***polymorph other*** to change gender, there would be at least a 50% chance that the attempt would fail. A ***wish*** certainly is more powerful than the 4th-level ***polymorph other***. If the character was ***polymorphed*** back to his original gender, a system-shock roll would be required.

            answer: [
                `Generally, spells are grouped into schools according to the types of effects they produce and, by extension, the type of power used to produce their effects. Abjuration blocks, dispels, or protects; alteration produces changes in its target; conjuration/summoning brings material from some other place; enchantment/ charm grants its users or targets special abilities; greater divination reveals information; illusion/phantasm causes perceived changes that are not real; invocation/evocation creates matter or energy; and necromancy provides or removes the energy of life. See ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook*** for detailed explanations of each school.`,
                `No two schools of magic are mutually hostile due to their natures; opposition arises from how the spells are learned and used. Specialist wizards employ methods of study and mental discipline that enhance their abilities to use certain types of magic and erode their aptitudes for others. This is why generalists can freely use magic from opposing schools while specialists cannot. Specific pairs of opposed schools were selected according to common sense and game balance. For example, if invokers spend a lot of time learning how to bring things into being from nothing, they probably neglect to learn how to call things from one place to another. Illusionists, who spend their time trying to create believable unrealities, have a hard time casting magic that produces and channels real energies; there are three such schools: invocation/evocation, necromancy, and abjuration.`,

The DM should decide which method to use, then use it consistently. Dual-classed characters use the level of the class in which they are currently active. If the character has more experience in the previous class, he can use the higher level but must pay the experience penalty for reverting to that class (***PHB***, page 45).`,

The "Larger Work Forces" section on the same page suggests that the savings be calculated per week, but if that's the case a character could get a castle for free just by cutting the work force in half and waiting patiently through the increased construction time. Also, if a character is feeling frugal but still is in a hurry, what's to keep him from reducing the work force but keeping it above 75% of normal, thus gaining substantial savings and not extending construction time?`,
            answer: [
                `The savings from reduced work forces is calculated per week, so dropping one worker saves 520 gp each year. However, ***The Castle Guide*** editor Bill Connors says there is some dropped copy in the "Smaller Work Forces" section. The last sentence in the second paragraph should read: "No reduction below 50% in the work force or cost is possible." While a castle builder can reduce labor and administration costs, he can't get them for free and must still pay for materials. Smart castle builders will adjust their work forces to get some savings, but I can think of two ways to discourage this if the referee thinks the practice is getting out of hand. First, an accident or misfortune (such as a raid or marauding monster) might deplete a reduced work force even further and cause a construction delay. Second, morale in the reduced work force might deteriorate. Workers who believe they are being asked to do the impossible tend to be resentful. This might prompt the referee to recalculate the Production Modifier in mid-project and declare a "cost overrun" for the castle.`,

                `Magic resistance applies only to spells and spell-like powers that directly affect the magic-resistant creature. Consequential effects, such as collapsing masonry resulting from an earthquake spell, ignore magic resistance. Magic resistance applies to any effect created through the memorization and casting of a spell, and to spell-like effects from wands, staves, rods, rings, and miscellaneous magical items. It does *not* apply to breath weapons, gaze attacks, energy draining, psionic abilities, and similar special attack forms; nor does it apply to effects that are intrinsic to an item, such as the magical "pluses" on an enchanted weapon or piece of armor. There are many cases where effects fall into a gray area, and the DM must rule on these as they come up. When in doubt, treat any effect that behaves like a spell (i.e., that operates when the user does something special to create it—concentrates, expends a charge from an item, etc.) as a spell.`,

However, many DMs rule that ***protection from evil*** is a special case, especially in campaigns where ***protection from evil*** is the only readily available defense against magic-resistant creatures. This is perfectly acceptable, since the power of ***protection from evil*** can be considered a consequential effect of a spell. A paladin's ***protection from evil*** power probably should be considered a special ability not subject to magic resistance, but it could be treated as a permanent magical effect (also see the ***DMG***, page 67, and the ***PHB***, page 102).`,

A successful proficiency check might reveal a plant's most common names and whether or not it is edible, poisonous, or medicinal. A successful proficiency check might also allow the herbalist to know where a certain plant grows and to find it if any are growing nearby. The DM must decide how powerful an herbal concoction is. In normal circumstances, I suggest that the herbalist be limited to mild poisons and weak healing balms. Mild poisons include types A, G, K, and O (see the ***DMG***, page 73). Herbal healing balms might include poultices that heal 1 hp damage when applied to wounds, salves that allow a resting character to gain one extra hit point each day, and the like; characters with the healing proficiency might be able to use these products with greater effect, say to heal 1-4 hp damage or gain an extra 1-4 hp per day of rest.

How would you simulate this skill in a game where the original AD&D game rules are used?`,
            answer: [
                `The DM should have been thinking about this while the PC was busy doing all his research. Since the game does not contain a poison-manufacturing proficiency *per se* (herbalism gives an incidental understanding of plant poisons, but many poisons are derived from animals or minerals), you'd have to create a new proficiency.`,
                `Such a proficiency might require two proficiency slots and be based on Intelligence -2. Depending on the campaign, this proficiency would fall under one or more of the following categories: wizard, priest, rogue. The character would have to expend at least two slots to get the skill; the time and effort the character is devoting to learning all about poisons is not going to be available for learning languages or other skills. However, you might allow the character to purchase extra slots for improving the proficiency once it has been bought, but only if the character has no other slots available and the proficiency score is not raised above 16. The proficiency might allow the character to do one or more of the following, at the DM's option: concoct any poison on the DMG's poison table (see previous question); create entirely new poisons; prepare poison antidotes; recognize the "poison potential" in any plant, animal, or mineral encountered; recognize a poison by its effect on a victim.`,
                `The DM must control such a proficiency very carefully to maintain play balance. Manufacturing poisons should be a long and difficult process (check the section on potion manufacture in the ***DMG***, page 87). Making poison under field conditions should require a substantial penalty, and failure under any circumstances should result in at least a chance for the poison maker to poison himself ("Ouch! I've just nicked myself with the knife I used to skin that tree frog."). Many poisons, particularly the very potent ones, should have a "shelf life" and would thus lose potency over time. They also might be destroyed when exposed to heat, cold, light, or electricity.

What about types of movement that might double as attacks? For instance, can a wizard ***polymorphed*** into a giant frog leap onto an opponent?`,
            answer: [
                `Basically, the ***polymorph self*** spell grants the caster the adopted form's shape an ordinary locomotion. The spell does not grant the adopted form's special attacks, senses, or magical abilities. The caster is not granted enough strength to perform extraordinary maneuvers, and the DM must decide where to draw the line when deciding what abilities the caster does get. In your example, a caster who assumed the form of a giant frog would be able to swim and hop about, but would not have a frog's all-around vision or full use of the creature's remarkable tongue. It is reasonable to deny the caster the ability to make spectacular leaps, as the spell description specifically limits the caster to "normal" movement. However, a frog's form is well suited to jumping, and the occasional long hop isn't out of the ordinary for a frog. The caster could jump, but he probably wouldn't have the strength or coordination to make very long jumps (a reduction of one-half or one-third would be about right—60-90' for a person ***polymorphed*** into a 50-lb. giant frog) or to make several leaps in succession. The caster certainly can belly flop onto opponents; resolve such attacks using the wrestling table (see the ***DMG***, page 59). Similarly, a caster who changed into an umber hulk would have a very limited ability to burrow through solid rock. A caster who took the form of a phase spider would get the ability to crawl along webs, but not the ability to shift phase or to spin webs of his own.`,

Many kinds of nondamaging hits can disrupt spell-casting: a hand clamped over the mouth, an armlock, or just being knocked down. However, damage always breaks concentration. If, for example, a spell-caster takes damage from a ***fireball*** or breath weapon, any spell in progress is lost even if the caster made his saving throw and took only half damage.`,
                `These distinctions also are important to game balance. Spell-casters are *intended* to be vulnerable to physical attacks during spell-casting, and their opponents *must* be given a chance to anticipate the spell and disrupt it before it goes off. Spell-casters can't get around this limitation by using spells such as ***stoneskin***. Likewise, spell-casting monsters that are immune to normal weapons (such as liches and vampires with character abilities) can have their spells ruined by any successful attacker. Some DMs even allow "attack" bonuses when characters make attacks specifically to disrupt a spell. The reasoning here is that a nondamaging jostle or cross block is easier to make than a potentially lethal blow. While this sort of ruling tends to be an equalizer when the target spell-caster is a high-level evil patriarch with an armor class in the negative numbers, it can be unreasonably tough on a 1st-level wizard with AC 10. Apply such bonuses carefully, if at all. I suggest that bonuses be limited to +4 or less, and you might consider applying them to the target's armor class rather than to the "to hit" roll. If you use the armor-class adjustment method, do not allow an armor class to be adjusted to worse than 10.`,

However, fist fighting and wrestling *can* be treated just like any other weapons that require proficiencies. If this is the case, the proficiency should be available to any character class. If a character spends a weapon proficiency on punching, he should get the extra melee attacks listed on Table 15, ***PHB***, page 26, if he is a high-level warrior.

                `This is entirely up to the DM. You've listed a couple of reasonable approaches to the problem. If wishes are fairly are in the campaign, and the DM feels that the need is justified, a special ability such as lock picking might be granted for a limited time, say as much as a month (but more likely a few turns or hours). If ***wishes*** are true rarities or if the DM really approves of high-powered player characters, it's fine to make the ability permanent, but I suggest that the ability be low powered, about one-third to one-half of what the average player character in the campaign might have. It's also a good idea to make the level of power fixed, not subject to improvement though experience. It certainly is acceptable to twist such wishes by changing the character into some creature that has the desired ability; such changes might be permanent or temporary. It also is fine to have a creature possessing the desired ability appear and serve the character for a short time.`,

It does not negate encumbrance penalties, nor does it allow characters to ignore armor restrictions due to character class (not even thieves). It is important to note that magic in the AD&D game is specific and specialized; collateral effects, even those suggested by logic, usually do not occur. While a character wearing a ***ring of free action*** can ignore the effects of an ***entangle*** spell, the wearer is not granted the ability to freely move through underbrush as can a druid. Likewise, there is no reason to assume that the wearer cannot float or swim in water. (On the other hand, individual DMs might rule that this is the case, and thus give the character a new problem to think about while adventuring in or near the water.)

            question: `How does the ***invisibility*** spell work? Does it make the recipient transparent? If so, why isn't it an alteration spell? If ***invisibility*** is illusory, who decides what a creature sees when looking through an ***invisible*** creature? (Since the subject is "removed" from the scene, something's got to replace it.) Why does attacking make the subject visible? Why doesn't the spell make objects the subject picks up disappear?`,
            answer: [
                `***Invisibility*** is illusory, and no one decides what a creature sees when gazing through an ***invisible*** creature. The recipient isn't removed; it is rendered visually undetectable. In campaigns in Lake Geneva, most people assume the spell bends light so it passes around the recipient rather than bouncing off the recipient or being blocked altogether. "Bent" light affects a creature's eyes in exactly the same way unbent light does, though very intelligent or powerful creatures have a chance to notice the bent light and get a saving throw against the effect (see the ***PHB***, page 142). There probably are many other workable explanations of the spells mechanics; for example, the retinas of a viewing creature's eyes might be rendered completely insensitive to the recipient's image. In any case, the spells effect is strictly limited to a live recipient (the spell description lists "creature touched" as the area of effect), and the spell has absolutely no power to change the way the subject's surroundings look.`,
                `If you take another look at the spell description, you'll see that items the subject picks up do become ***invisible***. For the purposes of this spell, anything the recipient can tuck into his clothing is considered part of the recipient. Attacks break the spell because the dweomer isn't powerful enough to continue hiding the recipient from creatures under attack. The instinct for self preservation sharpens the victims' perceptions, and the spell unravels.`,
                `Apparently, quite a few folks think ***invisibility*** ought to fall into the alteration school; if you are one of them, by all means go ahead and run it that way. However, one also can argue that ***invisibility*** is an enchantment because it grants the recipient the "power" to disappear—and to make objects disappear, too. ***Invisibility*** is called as an illusion because the spells primary effect is to change the way other creatures perceive the recipient (i.e., they have no visual perception of the recipient at all). As such, the spell is more akin to other perception-altering spells such as ***phantasmal force*** and ***blindness*** than to any other class of spell. (One also could argue that ***blindness*** is an alteration, since it "removes" sight, but the loss of sight is a change in the way the recipient perceives things, so the spell is classed as an illusion.)`

Chaotic characters are too impatient to meditate and too free thinking to accept the rules; therefore they cannot become psionicists. Many chaotic creatures have natural psionic abilities, but these creatures are not psionicists *per se*. Only chaotic-evil characters are terribly self centered; chaotic neutrals tend not to care about much of anything except for spreading chaos, and chaotic-good characters generally are concerned about other individuals' basic well being and freedom from oppression.

            ],
            answer: [
                `The people asking these questions all seem to share the same misconceptions about alignment. If questions similar to these have occurred to you, I suggest you carefully reread the section on alignments in the ***PHB***, starting on page 46. Pay special attention to the second paragraph on page 46, particularly the last sentence.`,
                `Alignments in the AD&D game are the cornerstones of characters' personalities. They help each player decide what a character's attitudes and values are, but they are guidelines, not absolute rules. The game's designers and editors do not assume that the entire spectrum of morality, ethics, and philosophy can neatly be categorized into nine strict divisions, and you shouldn't either. When picking an alignment for a player character, I suggest you spend some time thinking about what the character's disposition, principles, and sentiments are; then choose an alignment that fits the character.`,
                `Alignment is not defined by a single act. A good thief might indeed pick a pocket, and he might do so for any of many different reasons. He could lift a few coppers from an ostentatious fop to help feed a starving waif; he could filch the spell components from an opposing wizard during a combat encounter; or he might steal something outright, temporarily succumbing to greed (any character is entitled to commit the occasional slip). Note that, in the core AD&D 2nd Edition game, there are no lawful-good thieves (see ***PHB***, page 38).`,
                `I occasionally see a letter from a person who thinks of lawful-good characters as ruthless, heartless folk who relentlessly impress their own views on others, but that's the lawful-evil formula for living. "Good" implies altruism, kindness, and the ability to see that serving the welfare of others can promote one's own self interests. On the other hand, I get too many letters from people who think good characters, and lawful-good characters particularly, are doormats who'll always allow evil creatures take advantage of their nobler instincts. Not so. Lawful-good characters, especially paladins, usually have very definite ideas about what has to be done to promote goodness, and they are free to try all manner of things to achieve their goals. Torture usually is considered evil because helpless people are capriciously harmed; however, a lawful-good creature might very well use bluff, intimidation, or even stronger measures to get vital information from a captive in order to better protect the innocent or confound a great evil. One severe interrogation, administered at the right time and for the right reason, does not make an inquisition.`,
                `I get a lot of letters from people having trouble with the druidical ethos. Druids in the AD&D game believe in a "natural order" in which good, evil, law, and chaos play equally important roles. The first two paragraphs under the "ethos" heading on page 37 of the ***PHB*** explain the major elements of druidical doctrine.`,
                `Contrary to popular belief, maintaining "balance," especially on a personal scale, is not a druidical priority. According to the druidical view, there is a universal cycle that constantly shifts the cosmic balance between the eight "extreme" alignments. Even major shifts in the balance don't bother druids, since any one alignment's ascendancy is as temporary as fine summer weather. Druids are, however, on the lookout for anything that might cause the balance to "stick." In the druidical view, a universe permanently turned good or evil would either be unproductive, like a world caught in eternal summer where the harvest never comes, or sterile, like a world gripped by endless winter. However, most parties' actions are insignificant when measured on a universal scale. Even heroic adventurers don't often get the chance the affect the whole cosmos, and very few mortals ever get the opportunity to affect the balance in a way that would concern a druid.`,
                `Druids do not deliberately change their actions to reflect first one alignment, then another. Such shifts would make a druid's actions totally unpredictable, which in turn would tend to promote chaos. Druids believe that each of the eight alignments is equally valid, so it doesn't much matter to a druid which alignment his recent behavior tends to favor; any alignment will do over the short run. Druids do tend to be nonjudgemental about good, evil, law, and chaos; and they try to remain flexible and uncommitted to any single moral, legal, or philosophical system. However, druids regard interalignment struggles as part of nature, and druids serve nature. Since druids regard conflict between alignments as necessary, they do not seek to prevent their parties from continuing the struggle, nor do they resent being pulled into it themselves. Staying completely aloof or blocking their companions involvement would be as "unnatural" as trying to keep the leaves from falling in the autumn. Also, druids aren't stupid. Most parties won't take kindly to having their efforts continually stymied by a contrary druid (remember, alignment does not make characters into doormats). Being nonjudgmental, druids tend to go along with whatever their party chooses to do unless the party's actions threaten trees, crops, wild plants, and other things the druid is pledged to protect.`,

            answer: [
                `It would indeed be silly to roll the dice every time a character attempts a task. However, nobody can try to do everything and succeed all the time. To stay between these two extremes, the DM must decide how difficult a task is and decide what skills are necessary to complete it. There are some things just about anybody could do; for example, it doesn't take the rope use skill to tie one's shoes, nor does it take the carpentry skill to nail two boards together. However, some skills *look* a lot easier than they really are. Canoes, for example, have a nasty habit of moving in circles when improperly paddled. Likewise, rowboats also are fond of orbiting or not moving at all when an inexperienced oarsman tries his hand. While a character with seamanship probably shouldn't have to roll to control a boat or canoe on a calm lake, unskilled characters are in for a hard time even under such favorable conditions. Also, there are some tasks that unskilled characters cannot complete. Only a carpenter has enough knowledge to build an entire house, and only a seaman can hope to control a boat or canoe through a dangerous rapids or during a windstorm.`,
                `When adjudicating attempts that fall into the middle ground, the DM should decide how difficult the task is and how much specialized knowledge is needed for success. A skilled character probably can automatically complete an absurdly simple task even under poor conditions (perhaps failing only on a roll of 20), while an unskilled character might have to try harder. For example, a character with rope use might be able to tie his shoes with one hand or while hopping on one foot, while an unskilled character might have to make a roll. A good rule of thumb in such cases is to use the normal proficiency score reduced to one half or one quarter (round fractions down); the more difficult the task, the less chance there is for success. Consider the circumstances carefully. The world-record long jump currently is 29'2½", but this does not mean that every adventurer can leap a 10' pit with ease; encumbrance, damage, footing, lighting, even ceiling height will affect any attempt to jump. The DM should decide on a case-by-case basis using common sense. The DM should try to avoid making the campaign a slave to the proficiency system, but making the players *think* their characters out of a predicament is better than allowing them to extricate themselves by calling on skills the characters don't have.`,

                `There are several magical items that work only for specific classes. In each case, game logic and game balance play a role. Game logic in this case is unclear, but it probably goes something like this: The potions enhance, not create, the warrior potential in a character. Zero-level characters and warriors have the potential to be enhanced, but members of other classes do not. The latter have abandoned or suppressed any warrior potential while training to become members of their own classes. Game balance demands that there be distinct differences between classes. Class specialization in the AD&D game helps to insure that all characters are not near-clones trying to achieve the same menu of skills and abilities. Clearly defined character classes also make teamwork necessary, since one or two characters cannot do everything that might be required for successful adventures. This also promotes role-playing and campaign longevity. Most magical items that duplicate class abilities are class specific. Otherwise, class distinctions would disappear and a typical party would become a homogeneous mix of wizards turned healers, wand-toting fighters, sword-swinging priests, and scrying rogues.`,

            question: `How should ability score checks be handled for monsters with no defined abilities? For example, how do I determine the dexterity score for a horse or a hill giant?`,
            answer: [
                `If the question comes up during play, it's best to decide quickly. Keeping the game moving is more important than making a precise calculation. I suggest that you assume that any monster has average ability scores (about 10). Just roll a 1d20 for ability checks; if the result is 10 or less, assume the creature passes the check.`,
                `If the roll is higher, start figuring: Roll 1d3 to get the base ability score. In the case of dexterity, add one or two to the base score if the creature is described as agile, quick, or sure footed (subtract one or two for clumsy creatures). You might add a point for a high movement rate and one point for every multiple of three that the land or water movement rate rises above 12 or every multiple of six for air movement above 18 (you can subtract points at the same rate for exceptionally slow creatures). Generally, creatures with multiple legs are more sure footed than bipedal creatures, allowing one point for each pair of legs after the first two. The situation will exclude some modifiers; a horse might get modifiers for speed and legs when determining if it can jump a fence, but it might get none for deciding if it slides down a rocky slope. On the other hand, a basilisk probably couldn't jump over a matchbox but would get credit for its eight legs when negotiating slopes. Giants are notoriously clumsy, but their sheer size allows them to simply ignore most obstacles.`,
                `When calculating other ability scores, consider the following: Strength generally equates to size; tiny creatures might receive a -2, small creatures a -1, man-sized creatures no modifier, large creatures a +1, and so on. Creatures especially noted for strength, such as draft horses, might get an extra point or two. If a creature has any damage modifiers from strength, use Table 1 in the ***PHB*** to estimate its strength score. Wisdom generally equates to intelligence, with an extra point or two if the creature has priest spells or is noted for its cunning or guile. Most monsters have higher than normal constitutions (say 11-13), modified for size as per strength. Most monsters have low charismas (say 8-10) with extra points added for high intelligence and times when a creature deals with other monsters of the same alignment. Needless to say, it's always better to go through this process *before* play begins when possible.`

If, for example, the caster orders the steed to swoop own and attack a foe, but the caster is slain before he gets there, the steed follows the last command—to swoop—and probably will smack the ground at a high rate of speed as there is nobody to stop its dive.

Can the victim do anything while in the ***maze*** except try to escape? That is, can he cast a spell, drink a potion, scry, lay on hands, etc.? Can a ***teleport without error*** spell be used to escape the ***maze***, since it allows the caster to "jump" planes?`,
            answer: [
                `The spirit of the spell description suggests that the nature of the labyrinth created by the maze spell prompts the victim to escape as soon as possible, and that no actions other than escape are possible while a victim is within. The victim can try a spell to get out, but he cannot do anything that does not contribute directly to escape. A slain victim is no longer a creature and is not subject to the spell, which affects only creatures. A ***held*** victim cannot begin to escape until the ***hold*** spell wears off, but the maze spell's duration can never exceed eight turns. Likewise, an unconscious victim will emerge from the labyrinth when its duration expires 2d4 turns later. Note that the victim's intelligence, not speed, is the primary factor in escape; a slowed victim does not spend additional time in the labyrinth. If the labyrinth's "shifting planes of force" are similiar to ***walls of force***, sighted victims would have to feel or sound the way out, as the planes would be invisible. In any case, the spell description implies that the labyrinth is a visually confusing place, so blind victims should have no extra difficulty escaping and creatures well adapted to blindness might escape more easily at the DM's option. Local conditions can make ***teleportation*** of any kind impossible, and the labyrinth would seem to be one of those places.

If a conjured or summoned creature fails its magic resistance roll, it is hedged out by the ***anti-magic shell*** and all its abilities and items work normally. However, the ***anti-magic shell*** continues to negate any of the creature's magical effects that are cast into it. In no case does magic resistance allow nonartifact magical items to continue functioning inside an intact ***anti-magic shell***.

The term "force" indicates things that are not physical objects but that have physical effects, such as lightning—but a group of beings organized into a military unit or for other purposes also is a "force." I once saw an interesting compromise between these two views: The DM allowed ***phantasmal*** units of creatures, but only if all the creatures in a unit were identical and only if they all moved and acted together. It also isn't contrary to the spirit of the rules to allow ***phantasmal*** cave-ins or avalanches. If you interpret the description narrowly, these are out of the question because they are made up of many small objects; however, the individual objects *are* part of a larger whole. Note that anything created by a ***phantasmal force*** spell (and its cousins, the ***improved phantasmal force***, ***spectral force***, and ***advanced illusion spells***) is strictly limited to the spells immobile area of effect.

            answer: [
                `This is a topic is too complex to deal with here. Until something official comes along, which may happen in 1992, individual DMs must make these decisions on a case-by-case basis by comparing ships designed for their campaigns with the ship statistics given on pages 28-33 of the ***Concordance of Arcane Space***, from the SPELLJAMMER boxed set. Here are a few unofficial suggestions for determining statistics and costs for new types of spelljammers:`,
                `A quick way to estimate a new ship's tonnage is to multiply its beam length by its keel length, then divide by 120 or 125. This works well only for the oblong hull types such as hammerships. Generally, a ship can carry one person per ton of displacement, and it requires one crew member per three tons of displacement. Converted groundling ships and large, blocky ships, such as neogi deathspiders and dwarven citadels, have poor maneuverability ratings (E or F). Compact, barrel-shaped ships, such as squid ships and hammerships, have midrange ratings (C or D), and light ships with lots of sail area have high ratings (A or B). Judging from the repair rules on page 70 of the ***Concordance***, building a ship from scratch is much more expensive than buying one "as is!" About 1,000 gp per ton seems to be an accurate figure for medium-sized, fairly maneuverable ships (30-60 tons, maneuverability class D) made of thick wood. This cost does not include large weapons or motive power, though the builder might offer the purchaser a package deal. Highly maneuverable ships, or ships made of metal or ceramics, would cost more per ton. The 1,000 gp/ton figure is significantly lower than the repair costs, but I assume the listed repair costs reflect quite a bit of haste and desperation.`,

Note also that when two objects touch, the larger object's gravity is dominant. For example, a 50-ton ship touching a 20-ton asteroid imposes *its* gravity on the asteroid. Individual DMs might rule that certain planets immediately override a ship's gravity when the ship enters their gravity wells.

The helmsman must rest for as long as normal for him to regain the spells he currently has memorized; spelljamming does not erase the spells' patterns from the helmsman's brain, but it does disrupt the flow of magical energies within it (see page 34 of the ***Concordance***). The minimum time required to regain spell-casting ability is "a restful night's sleep" (see the 2nd Edition ***Player's Handbook***, page 81). For spelljamming purposes, this probably should be eight hours, though it may be slightly shorter or longer if the DM assigns a rest requirement that varies with the level or type of spells to be cast.

However, if the air envelope is small enough (created by an object of 10 tons displacement or less), the air is immediately fouled if it wasn't already, which might cause problems for living creatures who depend on the air envelope. Poison-gas breath weapons from dragons, such as those of green and gold dragons, immediately foul air envelopes unless their tonnage is more than five times the dragon's hit dice. However, green and gold dragons are immune to gas attacks and are unharmed by air that has been fouled by such attacks, including ***stinking clouds***, ***cloudkills***, and similar spells; as far as the dragon is concerned air made foul by such attacks still is fresh, and it remains fresh for the normal period of time.`,

The ***clone*** is almost indistinguishable from the original, as it has all the original's memories and abilities. A particularly clever ***clone*** might try to make mischief by committing crimes in the originals name, but note that the ***clone's*** prime motivation is to slay the original before insanity sets in, which usually takes a week.

DMs are free to decide if the swords ***sunray*** power can be used while attacking; it's reasonable to assume the vigorous overhead swinging required to evoke the ***sunray*** would preclude attacks. On the other hand, the rules aren't precise about what vigorous overhead swinging really is, so it's not unreasonable to assume that the wielder can't just add an overhead flourish or two while attacking. If you decide to allow attacks while maintaining the ***sunray***, you might want to impose a to-hit or initiative penalty (say, -2), or both.

No glow surrounds the caster, but the caster can create one burst each round (unless he is attacking or performing some other action other than movement) anywhere within the spell's range. I can't think of any overwhelming reason to assume that the caster should know how long the spell will last. How-ever, an unknown and variable duration might make casting this high-level spell far too chancy for some campaigns. A reasonable compromise might be to keep the total duration secret from the caster, but tell him if the spell has ended before he declares his actions for the round (see the ***PHB***, page 93).`,

Can two different girdles be worn at the same time (e.g., a ***girdle of many pouches*** and a ***girdle of giant strength***)? Can magical cloaks be worn with magical robes? Can magical boots be worn over magical slippers?`,
            answer: [
                `First, let's define a few terms for gaming purposes: A ***bracer*** is a forearm protector. It can be as compact as a very wide bracelet or large enough to cover the whole forearm; bracers are made of metal, leather, or heavy cloth. A ***gauntlet*** is a hand protector that covers at least the wrist and back of the hand, although it might also cover the fingers and most of the forearm; gauntlets are made of metal, leather and metal, leather, or heavy cloth. A glove at least covers the palm and back of the hand, though it can go from the fingers all the way above the elbow. A ***girdle*** is a belt, simple or elaborate, worn about the waist or hips. A ***robe*** is a garment fitted to the body and usually worn over other clothing; minimally, a robe covers the torso from the neck to the waist, but usually is longer. A robe may or may not have sleeves. Any garment that covers the body, from a shirt to a dress, might be called a robe. A ***cloak***, ***cape***, or ***mantle*** is a loose, usually sleeveless outer garment hung from the shoulders and worn over other clothing. Generally, a cloak is long and full, covering the body from the neck to below the knees and sometimes to the ankles. A cape is shorter and narrower than a cloak, covering the back from the neck to the waist. but sometimes longer. A mantle covers the shoulders, front and back. Cloaks, mantles, and robes can be hooded, but capes are not. Boots are sturdy, close-fitting garments that cover the foot from toe to ankle and sometimes the entire leg as well. ***Slippers*** are lightweight and cover the soles of the feet, toes, and heels, but might cover the ankles as well.`,
                `Generally, two or more items can be worn together if they cover different parts of the body. There are both logical and game-balance reasons for this. Obviously, a character wearing two or more cloaks is going to be just as overly powered as a character wearing three or more rings. Furthermore, game logic assumes a magical garment must fit reasonably well to function. The items cease to function if a character layers them on until he looks like a walking laundry basket.`,
                `Some garments do overlap in normal use. A robe can be worn with a cape, mantle, or cloak, but a character can wear only one robe and one cape, mantle, or cloak. Bracers can be worn with gloves or gauntlets. Some gauntlets are made to be worn over gloves; indeed, there is no reason why a campaign can't have some gauntlets that fit over gloves and some that do not. Many people in the Middle Ages wore two belts; one was high on the waist to hold up breeches or hose and to hold pouches and tools, and one rode on the hips, usually to support a sword or other large weapon. Sometimes people wore two belts crossed over the hips and a third on the waist. I suggest that two magical belts or girdles be the absolute limit, and only if they have different functions (e.g., one that augments ability scores or skills, such as a ***girdle of giant strength***, and one for carrying equipment, such as a ***girdle of many pouches***). A character can wear only one set of outer footgear. Any garment thin enough to be worn inside a pair of shoes or boots would be called a sock, not a slipper.`

Are they exceptions to the rule? Are these deities restricted to their home planets? If so, how can Quetzalcoatl keep his vow to return to the valley of Mexico? How can Ometeotl be barred from going anywhere if he's the embodiment of the universe? How can an omnipotent deity such as this have such limits, and why would such a deity need an avatar? Tezcatlipoca is said to he unable to visit this Prime Material plane; isn't this another contradiction?`,
            answer: [
                `First, a careful rereading of page 6 of ***Legends & Lore*** will show that deities are not unable to visit the Prime Material plane, but they never do; this is because doing so automatically would draw the attention and ire of the other deities. No deity is inclined to risk destruction at the hands if his or her divine peers.`,

Like beings in other pantheons, the Aztec deities are quite interested in mortal affairs and won't tolerate direct divine interference in them. Exactly how Quetzalcoatl will keep his vow is up to the DM. Perhaps the other deities will respect it and allow him to return, or perhaps Quetzalcoatl expects his followers to pave the way for him in such a way as the other deities ***cannot*** object.`,

All deities share the limelight with other deity-class creatures who have the power to confound or even kill them. Avatars are handy for any deity, as an avatar can go places where the deity itself cannot go without recriminations. Also, note that deities can have multiple avatars working at different locations at the same time (10 avatars at once for a greater deity). Likewise, Tezcatlipoca is not ***barred*** from the mortal world any more than any other deity. He is in the habit of using his true form—rather than an avatar—to accomplish various tasks.

(Yes, I'm aware that the ***GREYHAWK® Adventures*** hardback says Iuz has no avatars, but if you're going to kick him off the Prime Material plane because of what ***Legends & Lore*** says, there's no reason you can't give him an avatar.) Note also that the ***Legends & Lore*** tome does not necessarily consider the way things work on Oerth; it is a general work describing how deity-class creatures fit into most campaigns. I can't think of a single reason why you can't have Iuz continue to prowl about the Flanaess, causing as much trouble as ever.

            question: `The various SPELLJAMMER™ rules hooks say that weapons can he add- ed to a ship at the cost of one ton of cargo space per weapon, to a maxi- mum number of weapons equal to half the ship's tonnage. Since cargo space also is equal to half the ship's tonnage, this means that all the ship's cargo space can be used up by extra weapons. I have two problems with this: First, what do cargo space and weapons have to do with each other? Second, the rule allows a ridiculously large number of weapons to be mounted on ships. A hammership, for example, at 60 tons, can mount 30 additional weapons!`,
            answer: [
                `The maximum number of additional weapons a ship can carry ***is*** one per two tons of displacement (***Concordance of Arcane Space***, pages 26-27). However, this is a theoretical number based on a ship's gross hauling capacity. Even a quick look at the deck plans in the SPELLJAMMER boxed set reveals that cramming a spelljammer with its maximum load of weapons would take *all* the ship's deck space. Of course, a truly warlike spelljammer captain might build a "double-topped" ship with fighting decks above and below the plane of gravity, but woe to the weapons' crews if the gravity plane shifts.`,
                `Speaking of crews, general-purpose spelljammers, such as most PCs would use, don't have the quarters or air necessary to sustain a huge number of weapons crews; this tends to lower the practical limit on the number of weapons a ship is likely to have. (On the other hand, a "monitor"-type ship dedicated to defending a planet, base, or section of wildspace might be packed to its crow's nest with weaponry, and ships crewed by undead would have no breathing-air restrictions.) Also, don't forget that weapons aren't free and are not available in unlimited quantities.`,
                `Extra weapons eat up cargo space for a variety of reasons. First, a ship's cargo capacity is an abstract figure that reflects both its interior volume and its ability to carry weight. A weapons-heavy ship might have empty space in its hull, but if overloaded with cargo it would probably maneuver like a wounded duck and have a nasty tendency to split open like a wet cardboard box in combat or when landing. Also, large weapons can't just be bolted onto a ship's deck; their mounts must be braced and supported so the weapons don't break loose when fired. This extra structure not only reduces the ship's payload, it also tends to make the ship less efficient as a cargo carrier (the extra posts and beams prevent the crew from packing cargo tightly, and they otherwise waste space). Also, don't forget that large weapons need ammunition, and some of the ship's cargo space has to be allocated to its storage.`

In a campaign with such a planar setup, astral and ethereal travel might very well be a workable alternative to spelljamming.

Magically created effects ignore magic resistance only if they are consequential. The rules governing magic resistance (***PHB***, page 102, or ***DMG***, page 66) use crevices created by an ***earthquake*** spell as an example. The spell ***earthquake*** does not create crevices; it creates tremors that in turn create crevices. As another example, lightning is a natural effect on the Prime Material plane and elsewhere.

These last two spells do not create or control lightning; they change and agitate the atmosphere in such a way as to make lightning possible. Note that ***call lightning*** creates and directs lightning on demand, and that each stroke called is an area effect subject to magic resistance. The spell ***ice storm*** can create damage-inflicting missiles that are subject to magic resistance, as is any other area of effect spell. However, a magic-resistant creature still is blinded, slowed, and vulnerable to slipping and falling if subjected to the sleet version of an ***ice storm***, because these are consequential effects.`,

            question: `The new ***PHB*** (page 22) says half-elves can be druid/rangers, but the table on page 44 does not mention this combination. What are the armor and weapon restrictions and alignment requirements for this multiclassed combination?`,
            answer: [
                `In the core AD&D 2nd Edition game, there are no druid/rangers. The reference to them on page 22 is an error, and that is why they don't appear in the table on page 44. In practice, however, druid/rangers work very well in play, offering a good mix of skills and lots of role-playing possibilities.`,
                `To determine the weapons and armor allowed to druid/rangers (if the DM decides to allow these characters at all), follow the rules on page 45 of the ***PHB***. Since a warrior priest must abide by the weapon restrictions of his mythos, the druid/ranger's weapons are limited to: club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff. The druid/ranger also must observe the druids special armor restrictions, thus being limited to leather armor and wooden shields. Since rangers must be good and druids must be neutral, alignment is a problem. I suggest that a druid/ranger's alignment be limited to neutral good.`,
                `Note that the rules on page 45—especially the weapons restrictions—tend to discourage multiclassed priests except for characters dedicated to the appropriate deities. For example warrior priests who follow war deities might have access to a useful selection of warrior armor and weapons (***PHB***, page 34) and will be far more effective as warriors than, say warrior clerics, who are limited to blunt weapons. Since the original rationale behind druid/rangers is that these two woodland professions have enough common interests to generate at least a few multiclassed characters, and since the druid/ranger by necessity already violates the druid's alignment restriction, the DM might wish to bend the rules a bit to allow druid/rangers to function more effectively as rangers. The best way to do this is to expand the weapons list to include at least one kind of bow and maybe the warrior's mainstay, the long sword. The DM also might consider lifting or altering the armor restriction. This might be easier if the character in question were actually dedicated to a specific woodland or elven deity (see next question).`,

            answer: [
                `The intent behind this ability clearly is to make the druid immune to the innate ***charm*** abilities possessed by fantastic creatures who live permanently in the forest. This keeps the druids status as master and protector of the forest from being undermined by capricious ***charm*** attempts from sylvan creatures who can't be counted on to use their abilities with common sense. The druid gains this ability because he taps into the same base of power that grants sylvan creatures their ***charm*** abilities. The immunity does not protect the druid from spells such as ***charm person*** or ***charm person or mammal***, even when cast by other druids or woodland creatures such as green dragons; their power comes from a different source.`,

            question: `The ***shadow monsters*** and ***demi-shadow monsters*** spells are listed under the illusion/phantasm school, but their descriptions say they draw matter from the plane of Shadow to create illusions of one or more monsters. Doesn't this make these spells conjuration/summonings or evocation/invocations? What happens if the caster isn't connected with the plane of Shadow at all? I suppose the spell might be partially successful even in this case if it were truly an illusion. Also, what is the difference between an illusion and a phantasm?`,
            answer: [
                `The spells in question are illusion/phantasms because their primary function is to make their victims believe in something that doesn't really exist. The inclusion of a small amount of extraplanar material make these spells very potent illusions (it is because of this trace of "real" material that they can inflict damage even if successfully disbelieved), but it does not make them conjuration/summonings. A full-blown conjuration/summoning or evocation/invocation brings forth a "real" object or creature, not one whose existence is diminished by active disbelief. If local conditions make a connection between the caster and the plane of Shadow impossible, then casting either of these spells also is impossible; it's all or nothing.`,
                `In game terms, there is very little difference between an illusion and a phantasm, which is why the two words usually are used together.

            answer: [
                `Like all the other "wall" spells, ***wall of fog*** is an evocation. It is so classed because it brings into being something that wasn't there before the spell was cast.`,
                `A great deal of game logic and concern for game balance underlies the schools as they presently are constructed, and I don't recommend fiddling with them, especially if you are using specialist wizards. The team who revised the game carefully considered the number of spells in each school and the kinds of adventuring "niches" each specialist would tend to fill, which is why spells with similar effects tend to fall into the same school even if the mechanics behind them don't seem to match at first glance. I also suggest that trying to second guess the game's designers is not the best way to role-play dealing with a rival. Having your character slip a raw egg into the rival character's boot is much more likely to produce an entertaining result than trying to tinker with the rules. If there's one thing more annoying than a rules lawyer, it's a rules lawyer who wants to change the rules.`,

I can't see any reason why a character couldn't get an extra punching attack each round by using the rules for attacking with two weapons (***PHB***, page 96), but remember to apply the appropriate penalties. A character has to use pretty much his whole body to wrestle or overbear, so you can't use the rules for attacking with two weapons to get an extra overbearing or wrestling attack each round. However, a high-level warrior who is allowed two attacks in a round *could* make two overbearing or wrestling attacks. In the case of overbearing, the warrior could knock down an opponent, then try to pin him. In the case of wrestling, the warrior could make two attempts to gain a hold, but if he gets a hold that can be maintained, damage from round to round accrues normally, not at a doubled rate.`,

The ***simulacrum*** also ignores damage to the creator, and the only effect that the creator's death has is that the ***simulacrum*** no longer has someone that it must obey. *Since* a ***simulacrum*** is a fairly accurate replica of the original, its natural lifespan will be about as long as the original's; I suggest that it be exactly the same 40%-65% of the time.

                `According to page 110 of ***The Complete Psionics Handbook***, an ***anti-magic shell*** has no effect at all on psionics. The game logic behind this rule is that magic—which includes such special attacks such as breath and gaze weapons—and psionics are two different things. In terms of game balance, it is desirable to draw a firm line between magic use and psionics use. Psionics, the reasoning goes, is a type of power completely different from magic in all its various forms.`,
                `However, my colleagues at TSR, Inc. have made it clear to me that *all* the rules in the various handbooks are optional. Considering that ***anti-magic shells*** can stop things like gaze attacks, sonic attacks, and breath weapons—all of which ignore magic resistance—I don't think you'd be stretching things too far if you assumed the field created by an ***anti-magic shell*** stopped all preternatural effects of nondivine, nonartifact origin. Both magic and psionics involve the transfer and manipulation of some kind of power, and an ***anti-magic shell*** can be assumed to prevent the passage of such power.`,
                `Nevertheless, I suggest you tread carefully when mixing magic and psionics. Psionic powers are potent and must be adjudicated carefully even if you follow all the rules scrupulously. For example, if you blur the line between magic and psionics by introducing magical items that augment or bestow psionic powers, characters who accumulate a few of them can quickly become psionic juggernauts.`

On the other hand, a ***vorpal sword*** that has been ***polymorphed*** into a bardiche probably would keep its ability to sever necks. Very intelligent magical weapons changed into any form probably should lose some of their abilities when in ***polymorphed*** form even if these abilities have nothing to do with the weapon's size or configuration. Such weapons are the result of a long and intricate process, and even subtle changes in the weapon's form can disrupt the enchantment.

However, a little common sense and a careful rereading of the rules should shorten the time to create the ***wand of magic missiles*** in your example. First, the item's creator must gather the proper materials. This could take days, weeks, or months of game time, depending on how rare the DM decides to make the materials and how intelligently the character goes about gathering them.

A ***permanency*** spell is then required to fix the enchantment and prepare the item to receive charges. Once this is done, I suggest you use the rules for recharging magical items (***DMG***, pages 88-89). Each charge requires a separate spell with the normal casting time. As suggested in issue #172, the item needn't make a saving throw each time a charge is added, but the item does need to make a saving throw when "recharging" starts, and the creator is still limited to eight hours of work a day (or a full "load" of spells dumped into the item, whichever is less).

                `Use the Defiler Magical Destruction Table in the Rules Book, page 60. All plants and plantlike creatures in the area of effect perish, getting no saving throw. All other creatures having less than 4+2 HD ***or*** an intelligence of 4 or less also perish. For example, a mekillot has 11 HD but only animal intelligence (1), so it automatically dies.

                `Clerics receive major access to their elemental sphere of worship and minor access to the Sphere of the Cosmos (as stated on pages 29 and 59 of the Rules Book). Many additional priest spells will be presented in the ***Dragon Kings*** hardbound, along with rules for incorporating all ***Tome of Magic*** spells into the DARK SUN spheres. For now, I suggest you allow a priest major access to his elemental sphere, plus major access to the Sphere of the Cosmos; if you don't, no priest will ever get to cast a curative spell better than ***cure light wounds*** (as one reader pointed out), and priests of earth will get no fourth-level spells at all (as another reader pointed out). However, if incorporating all the spells from ***Dragon Kings*** and ***Tome of Magic***, only allow clerics to have minor access to the Sphere of the Cosmos.`,

Since all sorcerer-kings are accomplished psionicists, however, they would carefully examine the thoughts of at least their higher-level templars; this makes it unlikely that "moles" exist in any city's templar hierarchy. Likewise, a city-state's totalitarian government, the general populace's hatred and distrust of the templars, the sorcerer-king's shrewdness, and the obvious rewards available to any templar who embarrasses a superior or crushes a misbehaving subordinate make it pretty unlikely that any disloyal templar will survive for long. Finally, consider that all templars are either neutral or evil, and that the quickest way a templar can become wealthy and powerful is to remain loyal but corrupt. I don't think there would be undiscovered traitors in the templar ranks even if there could be.`,

Since all the attack and defense modes are telepathic sciences or devotions that are not listed on Table 12, the character can get them only if he rolls a 90 and gets to pick any two devotions, or rolls 91-00 and gets to roll on Table 13 (if he's very lucky and rolls a 00, he can pick a devotion and roll on Table 13). Since attack and defense modes also are not included on Table 13, the character can get them only if he continues to be lucky and rolls one of the "choose any" results on Table 13. Barring such good die rolls or some type of DM intervention, characters with wild talents don't get attack and defense modes.`,

                `A ***sleep*** spell can affect any creature that falls within the spell's hit-die limits, unless the creature's description specifically makes it immune. Athasian thri-kreen don't sleep, but they are not immune to any sort of magically or psionically induced sleep. As the Rules Book clearly states, all character races except thri-kreen are subject to the ***hold person*** spell (see spell description, page 95). Half-giants receive double hit points from their hit dice, not double hit dice; a third-level half-giant, for example, easily could have 60 hp or more but still is subject to ***sleep*** spells.`,

                `You have read the rules correctly. A character must refer to the Racial Ability Requirements table (actually Table 1; Rules Book, page 3) before applying the modifiers from Table 2 (also on page 3). Athasian halflings, however, probably should be at least as strong as halflings on other worlds, and maybe stronger. It's not unreasonable to give Athasian halflings a final strength limit of 18; however, Athasian halflings with 18 strength still do not roll for extraordinary strength, as their small bodies just don't carry enough muscle.`,

            question: `Since many nonwarrior characters on Athas can have strength scores of 19 or higher, how do you treat the extraordinary strength roll for an 18 strength on Athas?`,
            answer: [
                `Strictly speaking, you treat extraordinary strength exactly the way you do on any other world. That is, warriors with strengths of 18 roll on the extraordinary-strength portion of Table 1 in the ***PHB*** (page 14), and other characters don't. While a nonwarrior on Athas might be blessed with a great strength score, he doesn't have the training or discipline that allows a warrior to develop a strength score of 18 into something outstanding.`,
                `I know of one non-Athasian campaign that dispenses with extraordinary strength altogether. Under this house rule, a warrior with a 13 strength gets the benefits of an 18 strength, a warrior with a 14 strength gets the benefits of an 18/01 strength, and so on up to strength 18. The DM I met who used this rule claimed it made having that elusive 18 strength score less vital to the warrior. Nonwarriors, who have less physical training, used the regular strength table. Even if you adopt this rule, however, you'll still have a situation where a nonwarrior with a 19 or better strength score has vastly better combat modifiers than characters—even warriors—who have strength scores of 18 or less.`

            question: `Can thri-kreen use sign language, or do their nonhuman hands make this impossible? Why can't thri-kreen be thieves or templars? If they can, what are their level limits and thief skill adjustments?`,
            answer: [
                `A thri-kreen's hands and arms can certainly perform sign language of some kind. Since the Athasian sign language is the closest thing to a planet-wide tongue that Athas has, it's probably safe to assume that sign language takes into account and adjusts for differences between human and thri-kreen hands. (Even with all the differences described in the rules, there would literally be millions of gestures that both thri-kreen and human hands could preform.) The DM, however, might decide that the thri-kreen have their own version of sign language or that the physical differences in hands cause an ability-check penalty when humans or demi-humans use sign language to communicate with thri-kreen.`,
                `I'll spare my regular readers the standard sermon about racial-class and level restrictions and why they are necessary for game balance, and I'll plunge directly into a discussion about why thri-kreen don't become thieves or templars:`,
                `Thri-kreen are born hunters and warriors. Those thri-kreen who have a talent or liking for stealth and concealment become rangers, not thieves. Skulking about and playing with locks, traps, poisons, and other nefarious devices just doesn't suit this race. Thri-kreen also are hive creatures who are very dedicated and loyal to their group, even if there are non-thri-kreen in it and even if the individual thri-kreen in question is evil. The deceit, corruption, disdain for underlings, and disrespect for superiors displayed by the templars is completely alien to the thri-kreen.`

Just because a thri-kreen can attack with four claws does not mean it can coordinate four weapons at once. Before somebody writes and asks: No, this does not mean thri-kreen cannot hurl more than two missiles each round; they get the full rate of fire listed in the rules for darts and similar hand-hurled missiles (but they can't use their extra hands to get a rate of fire better than that listed in the rules). Statistics on four-handed weapons are up to the DM; however, I suggest that limits on thri-kreen strength and coordination make such weapons no more effective than two-handed weapons. Note also that thri-kreen can bite while wielding weap- ons, but they cannot claw while doing so. I suppose a kind DM might allow a thri- kreen to use a claw as a secondary weap- on under the "Attacking with Two Weapons" rule in the ***PHB***, page 96.`,

The worst effects of blowing sand are reduced visibility (Rules Book, page 84) and the fact that sand tends to get into everything, like clothing, armor, equipment, and provisions. Athas, however, probably has more than its share of extraordinary sandstorms. The DM will have to handle these on a case-by-case basis. I suggest that characters escape damage altogether if they have shelter of any sort (a tent or the lee side of any barrier such as a boulder, hill, or stand of cactus). Characters exposed to the full force of the wind might suffer 1-2 six-sided dice of damage per hour, turn, or minute, depending on how ferocious the storm is.

            question: `Does a saving throw or magic resistance apply to a ***warp marble's*** various effects? Can a creature trapped in the marble be freed by a ***dispel magic*** spell?`,
            answer: [
                `According to the item description (see ***Tome of Magic***, page 148) a saving throw applies only when the marble is set as a trap using the third command word and hurled at a creature. If the marble hits, the victim gets a save. If the item is set as a trap with the third command word, any creature touching it is trapped, with no saving throw. Likewise, the creature closest to the marble is automatically trapped when the first command word is spoken. The DM easily can prevent abuse of this ability by making the command word effective only at a very short range (I suggest 10'-20') and by introducing opponents who are inclined to crush untended marbles or hurl or kick them toward the owner or his party-in the latter case, the marble might trap the owner or one of his allies if the initiative roll turns out well. Likewise, I suggest that ***warp marbles*** develop a bad habit of bouncing around unpredictably when thrown, thus encouraging owners to use the third command word when handling them (since a bad bounce might inadvertantly trap a character employing the first command word). Note also that ***warp marbles*** can be safely manipulated with spears, other long implements, ***unseen servants***, and ***gusts of wind***, and in numerous other ways.`,
                `I suggest you treat the effects of a ***warp marble*** as an individually targeted effect subject to magic resistance (see the ***Player's Handbook***, page 102, or the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 67).`,
                `Since the extradimensional space created by a ***warp marble*** is fragile enough to be disturbed by ***teleportation*** and similar effects, I suggest that ***dispel magic*** can free a creature trapped inside, or expel a creature trapped voluntarily, if the spell succeeds (see the next question).`

            answer: [
                `According to the spell description (see the ***PHB***, pages 148 and 210), a ***dispel magic*** spell cast directly against an item automatically causes the item to cease functioning for 1d4 rounds *unless* the item is in a creature's possession; in that case, the creature is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to determine if the item ceases to work. I suggest you apply magical and racial bonuses to the save, but not dexterity bonuses. Most DMs define "possession" as holding, carrying, or using the item. For example, a mage riding a ***carpet of flying*** has possession of the carpet, but the same mage does not have possession if he rolls up the carpet and puts it on a table while studying spells. Note that ***dispel magic*** has no effect on a permanent magical item at all unless it is actually targeted on the item, and artifacts are always immune; however, spell-like effects produced by any item can be dispelled just as spells can be.`,
                `A ***rod of cancellation*** requires a successful melee to-hit roll before it can drain an item. If the rod's wielder scores a hit, use the table on page 152 of the ***DMG*** to determine if the item saves. Generally, no modifiers apply to this save except in extraordinary circumstances that the DM must adjudicate on a case-by-case basis. For example, a ***stone of good luck*** might affect the save, since losing a magical item is bad luck indeed (or perhaps good luck, if the item is *cursed*). Situational modifiers that affect the attacker, such as bad footing or reduced visibility, reduce the to-hit roll and do not improve the defender's chances. Likewise, circumstances that hinder the defender increase the to-hit roll and do not make the item more vulnerable once a hit is scored.`,
                `***Mordenkainen's disjunction*** automatically disenchants all magical items within 30' unless they are in a creature's possession. In that case, the creature makes one save vs. spells; if the save fails, all the creature's magical items are ***disjoined***.`

A ***ring of wizardry*** does not actually boost the character's level.

Only fresh writing implements can be used to create scrolls; once a quill or printing plate is used to create a scroll, the residual magical energies remaining on it will spoil all future attempts (see the ***DMG***, page 86). Furthermore, inscribing a spell onto a scroll requires the creator to know the spell (if he's a wizard, that means having it in his spell books) and to expend the appropriate material component and suffer any normal penalties (such as unnatural aging) associated with the spell. While this latter requirement is not mentioned on page 86, it is implied on page 145 (see "Casting Scroll Effects"); it also is necessary for game balance, as PCs otherwise would avoid paying for expensive material components and avoid nasty side effects by writing scrolls instead of casting spells directly.`,

Still, I think the spirit of this rule (see the ***PHB***, page 21) is to subject dwarves to occasional complete but benign magical-item failures. I suggest that any partial failure still render the item completely ineffective; the ***AD&D Trivia Game*** uses a ***ring of invisibility*** that makes a dwarfs legs disappear as an example. Likewise, a dwarf who has a ***broom of flying*** fail should not be able to limp away a slow flying speed. On the other hand, malfunctions probably should not actually cause harm; a malfunctioning ***ring of invisibility*** shouldn't partially disintegrate a dwarf, and a ***broom of flying*** shouldn't eject a dwarf while in the air or beat him the way a ***broom of animated attack*** does.

            question: `In "Sage Advice" in issue #156, you said a heavy catapult and a trebuchet were two different things. However, the SPELLJAMMER™ boxed set's ***Concordance of Arcane Space*** (page 40) says that a heavy catapult is a trebuchet. Also, if trebuchets can hurl rocks weighting 500 lbs., how can they be fitted onto spelljammers? If a trebuchet is a separate item, how much does it cost? How big would a ship have to be to have one? What are this weapon's other statistics?`,
            answer: [
                `I didn't actually say that catapults and trebuchets were different in issue 156, but they are according to the histories I've read. Technically, a catapult is a torsion-powered siege engine. A catapult's torsion (twisting or springing) power was usually provided by either tightly wrapped skeins of horsehair or layers of green boards arranged like the leaf springs on an automobile's suspension.`,
                `To get an idea of how a twisted-skein catapult worked, stretch a rubber band between your thumb and forefinger. Now take a *capped* ballpoint pen or unsharpened pencil and stick it between the two strands of rubber. If you flip the pen end over end a few times like an airplane propeller, you'll twist and tighten the rubber band; you'll have to slide the pen in and out a bit (because your hand will be in the way) to rotate the pen fully. When you've got the rubber band really tight (and aimed away from your face), let go. The rubber band will flip the pen over quite forcefully. The catapult's skeins were tightened by men on either side of the catapult who turned cranks connected to the skeins, tightening them up without moving the catapult arm, which was held back. Once the arm was released, the torsion in the twisted skeins flung the arm in an arc that was stopped by a crosspiece on the machine itself; the ammunition, which had been placed in a cup on the end of the arm, was then hurled away.`,
                `The leaf-spring catapult worked just like a big crossbow. In fact, the only difference between this kind of siege engine and a ballista (which worked exactly like a big crossbow) was that a catapult had a long arm with a cup or pouch at one end for throwing stones in a high arc; in place of the arm, a ballista had a slide that hurled a rock or large bolt in a flat arc.`,
                `A trebuchet, however, was powered by a counterweight. A long beam was placed on a pivot, with one end of the beam a lot closer to the pivot than the other. A heavy weight was hung at the beam's short end, and a pouch for holding rocks was hung on the other, then tied down; the whole weight of the short end was always far greater than the entire weight of the long end and its ammunition. When a loaded trebuchet was fired by releasing the long end, the weight snapped the long end upward, and the rock in the pouch was hurled away. If you've ever seen a troupe of acrobats working with a seesaw, you've got the idea.`,
                `In historical terms, the SPELLJAMMER setting's light catapult probably is similar to the historical onager, a small twisted-skein torsion engine that hurled a rock that weighed about 10 lbs. The medium catapult probably is similar to a larger skein- or leaf-spring torsion engine that hurled a 25-lb. rock (in landsman's terms, this would be a heavy catapult; the SPELLJAMMER setting has adopted its own terminology). The spacefarers heavy catapult, or "trebuchet," would be a very large torsion engine hurling a 40- or 50-lb. rock; page 40 of the ***Concordance*** defines catapults as "large, stone-throwing devices operated by springs, cranks, or flywheels." I doubt that very large counterweight engines could be used on spelljammers at all, except on dwarven citadels and other massive bodies of 300 tons or more. If you want to introduce such weapons into your campaign, you're on your own.`,
                `As a general rule of thumb, I suggest that doubling the weight of the missile should increase the hull damage to the next higher step. For example, a weapon hurling an 80-lb. rock would do 2d6 hull points. Each increment of increased damage should cost an extra 300-400 gp, reduce the THAC0 by one (20 maximum), take one extra crew, reduce the rate of fire by one, and increase the weapon's "count" by one. So, our "80-pounder" would cost 1,300-1,400 gp, require five or six crewmen, have a THAC0 of 19, have a rate of fire of 1/3 or 1/4, and would count as three large weapons installed. I suggest that you do not allow the critical-hit numbers and crew-damage ratings to increase beyond the heavy catapult's 18-20 and 3d10 values.`

            answer: [
                `If you think a 6"-tall character can't do much damage with a fighter's traditional weapons, you're right—especially if he fights any foe larger than a cockroach. However, diminutive swords, battle axes, and the like still do more damage than tiny fists and feet. (I suppose a 6" monk wearing a ***girdle of giant strength*** might be able to do some interesting things with judo throws; a cartoon character called Atom Ant comes to mind.)`,
                `Strictly speaking, the ***haste*** effect ends as soon as the character becomes a 5th-level monk; the discipline and control the monk imposes on his body forces it to return to its normal (non-***hasted*** or non-***slowed***) state. Also, most campaigns disallow permanent ***haste*** effects, as they tend to unbalance play. Furthermore, this combination tends to burn out characters, as it magically ages the character in either edition of the AD&D game. In the original game, a ***haste*** recipient not only ages a year, but also must make a *system shock* roll or perish. In either edition of the game, I recommend that the permanently ***hasted*** character reroll for system shock periodically, like every day, week, or month; a character's body can take only so much abuse. Note also that the character should age at least twice the normal rate, and the DM would not be out of line to rule that the character actually ages an extra year every hour, week, or month.`,

A second ***haste*** spell will not affect a ***hasted*** character in either edition, nor can a ***hasted*** character benefit from a ***potion of speed***.

If a human was ***polymorphed*** into a bunny and some of the bunny's fur was taken, then the bunny was ***polymorphed*** back into a human, would the fur sample turn back into human hair or would it stay bunny fur? In other words, will a ***lightning bolt*** spell blow up in my wizard's face if he uses the bunny fur as a material component?`,
            answer: [
                `First, in either edition of the AD&D game, the tarrasque is a unique creature. A DM can decide that a whole race of tarrasques populates the world, but there are more original ways to challenge player characters. Second, ***shape change*** works only on the caster/user, so no one can use it like a ***polymorph other*** spell; if ***shape change*** could be used on creatures other than the caster, it would give the recipient the ability to change its shape and all such changes would be under the recipient's control, not the caster's, I'm not sure what form a tarrasque would choose if it could ***shape change*** itself, but it wouldn't be likely to bring any joy to the spell-caster, whatever that shape happened to be.`,
                `Of course, even a tarrasque might fall victim to a ***polymorph other*** or ***polymorph any object*** spell. In either edition of the AD&D game and in the D&D game, a ***polymorphed*** creature keeps its hit points, natural armor class, and possibly other purely physical abilities; in the tarrasque's case this includes regeneration and maybe even its limb-severing bite. So, your tarrasque/bunny still is one tough customer: A 300-hp bunny with AC -3, at least two attacks (bite and kick), and a legendary regeneration ability. Even if one managed to eat this creature, you'd still need a ***wish*** to keep it dead (see the tarrasque's description in the ***Monstrous Compendium***, volume 2).`,
                `Since ***polymorphed*** creatures assume their normal shape when killed, I suggest that any pieces cut from them change back, too. After all, being separated from the rest of the creature is a "death" of a sort. In the case of the tarrasque/bunny, the creature would change back when reduced to -30 hp, or perhaps any time after being reduced to below zero hit points if the DM so decides. This method clears up esoteric questions such as, "Can I use ***polymorphed*** human hair as a material component for a ***lightning bolt*** spell?" It also keeps player characters from using ***polymorph*** magic as a cheap shortcut when creating scrolls, potions, and other magical items.`

            question: `Suppose an explosive ***dimensional mine*** is thrown into an extradimensional ***flatbox*** at the exact instant the ***disintegration chamber*** it inhabits is activated. The resulting confluence of dimensions destroys the contents of the ***flatbox*** and opens a rift to the Astral plane. Now, the real question is: Do the magically shrunk, mated pair of immortal astral dragons that were sleeping inside the ***flatbox*** instantly recover all their lost hit points (because they are immortal), and if so where do the dragons wind up after the explosion and rift formation?`,
            answer: [
                `You're definitely misreading the descriptions of the magical items involved here (all three are from the ***Tome of Magic***, pages 136-137). ***Dimensional mines*** are inert until placed inside extradimensional spaces. Even then, a ***dimensional mine*** does not explode; it ruptures the extradimensional space, and any matter inside the space is spewed into the Astral plane. The effect does not damage the contents of the space. ***Flatboxes*** don't inhibit magic at all, though by their very nature they cannot be illuminated. A ***disintegration chamber*** produces no spectacular effects when brought into an extradimensional space, and it cannot destroy anything that is not inside it (even then, nothing happens until somebody pushes the button).`,
                `In the situation you describe, the ***flatbox*** could explode when the ***dimensional mine*** was tossed inside, as the ***flatbox*** is an extradimensional space that has a bad habit of exploding when it's disturbed. However, it does not have to explode; it could just be ruptured. The ***disintegration chamber*** would be utterly destroyed in such an explosion, and the dragons would survive and get sucked through the rift and tossed onto the Astral plane. Whether the dragons were inside the ***disintegration chamber*** when it was activated is irrelevant, as their immortality (see their description in the ***Monstrous Compendium***, DRAGONLANCE® appendix) allows them to survive being simultaneously "destroyed" and ***disintegrated***.`

            question: `If a thief lost an arm just below the elbow, would he still be able to wear a magical bracer on the stump? Could he wear a bracer over a prosthesis? What effect would the loss have on the character's thief abilities? If he originally weighed 115 lbs., what would his new weight be?`,
            answer: [
                `Bracers are made to be worn on the wrist or forearm. Individual DMs are free to decide if amputee characters can use bracers (and other items that must be worn) by wearing them on stumps or prostheses. Check out "Sage Advice" in issue #172 for a discussion of where various types of magical equipment are normally worn.`,
                `The DM must decide whether the loss of a limb or appendage will affect thieving abilities at all. There's no reason to assume that the character cannot simply adapt and go on performing just as before. If the DM isn't feeling this generous, I suggest a penalty of 5-25 on all applicable percentile thieving abilities. For example, the one-handed thief mentioned above will suffer no penalties to his ability to hear noise, move silently, or hide in shadows, as he doesn't need to use his arms and hands to do these things. The character might suffer a penalty to pick pockets or find and remove traps. The DM could decide that this one-handed character has fewer options when picking pockets, and he could assess a -5 penalty to his percentile chance for success. The DM also might decide that rogues don't use their hands much when finding traps, but that two hands are helpful when removing traps, and so assigns no penalty to "find" and a -10 to "remove." Finally, the DM might decide to assign a -15 penalty to climb walls, since the character's remaining three appendages are going to be very busy when the character is climbing. If penalties are assessed, I strongly suggest that the DM give the character an opportunity to acquire some adaptive equipment and a chance to practice using it. The easiest way to simulate this is to use the "Training" optional rule (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 49).`,
                `As to the loss of weight, the character should lose about 4% of his total weight (4.6 lbs., in this case) for losing roughly half an arm. "Sage Advice" discussed this calculation in issue #156 (see the "legless gnome" question).`

            question: `Exactly how many gnomes can an adult griffon carry without losing its speed or altitude, physical attacks or fearsome temperament?`,
            answer: [
                `A typical gnome, without equipment, weighs about 82.5 lbs., but this figure can be as little as 73 lbs. or as much as 92 lbs. (***Player's Handbook***, page 24, Table 10). Carrying capacities for most flying creatures that can be used as mounts are conspicuous by their absence from the creatures' descriptions in the various ***Monstrous Compendium*** volumes. For the sake of game balance, I suggest that the most common flying mounts—pegasi, griffons, and hippogriffs—have the same carrying capacity. The Pegasus description in MC1 lists this as the same as a medium war horse: 220 lbs. at full speed, 330 lbs. at half speed, and 440 lbs. at one-third speed. As a general rule, a flying mount loses one maneuverability class when carrying a rider. I suggest that a winged mount loaded to the one-third movement class be unable to fly at all. Note that there is no reason a DM could not apply the movement rate and carrying capacity modifiers from the horse quality rules (***DMG***, pages 36-37) to flying mounts, too.`,
                `As to the question of a loaded griffon's temperament: Griffons are infamous for their nasty dispositions, and carrying loads doesn't make them any happier. Except for reductions to its maneuverability and movement, a griffon carrying a load still can fight normally. However, I suspect a griffon would strongly resent carrying multiple riders or being overloaded. Such a beast probably will try to shed—or even eat—excess riders.`

            question: `Where can a wizard put a ***sphere of annihilation*** when he is not using it?`,
            answer: [
                `You can "put" a ***sphere of annihilation*** anywhere you want when you are not using it, just by commanding it to stop. Of course, somebody else could set it in motion again by trying to control it, so it behooves the owner to park his ***sphere of annihilation*** in a safe place, like a locked vault. (For an example of a creative use of a ***sphere of annihilation*** stored in this way, see "The Living City" in POLYHEDRON™ Newszine issue #52.)`,
                `Since the effect a ***sphere of annihilation*** will have on its surroundings can vary widely from campaign to campaign, it might be useful to discuss this item's properties in some detail. Simply put, a ***sphere of annihilation*** is a hole in the fabric of the multiverse. Like other holes, a ***sphere of annihilation*** is benign until something falls into it.`,
                `However, the strictest possible interpretation of a sphere's powers (***DMG***, page 180) yields a pretty terrifying point. Since anything that contacts the sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed, a ***sphere of annihilation*** moving through the air might be accompanied by a continuous rumble of thunder as the air it encounters is annihilated and more air rushes in to fill the vacuum. Even at rest, a ***sphere of annihilation*** might eventually strip a planet of its atmosphere as it annihilates each and every gas molecule that touches it. A single such sphere could drain oceans and maybe even gobble up stars and planets; if one does not place a size limit on what the sphere can annihilate, it could suck in the whole earth instantly just by touching the ground. The only way to safely store a sphere under these conditions would be to seal it into an airtight vault, where it eventually would annihilate the air around it and create a perfect vacuum. Nevertheless, a more responsible approach would be to destroy the sphere with a ***rod of cancellation*** as quickly as possible.`,
                `I think it's far more reasonable to assume that fluid matter, such as a body of water or an atmosphere, will tend to flow around the sphere rather than contacting it and being annihilated. Of course, air or water could be fanned or ladled into the sphere, where it would be annihilated. This effect is similar to what would happen if a ***portable hole*** was spread out on a sand beach. The hole displaces the sand without otherwise affecting it, and no sand falls into the hole unless it is pushed inside. I also suggest that a ***sphere of annihilation*** be unable to utterly destroy anything bigger than it is. If, for example, the character controlling the sphere plunges it into the earth or into a castle wall, the sphere bores a 2' hole instead of sucking the entire "object" into oblivion. Likewise, small, man-sized, and large creatures might survive touching a sphere unless they fall completely into it. (See the previous question on "amputee thief" for possible consequences of misadventures with ***spheres of annihilation***.) Tiny creatures probably don't have enough strength or mass to resist being sucked into a sphere if they are unfortunate enough to touch it.`

            question: `The paragraph in the ***PHB*** that describes the Artistic Ability nonweapon proficiency (page 57) says that the artistic character is "naturally accomplished in various forms of the arts." The description goes on to say that if the character fails a proficiency check, he "has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad." Being something of an artist myself, I can tell you that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think characters viewing the work should be the ones to make the proficiency check to determine if they can perceive some value in it. After all, if the character has natural talent, he would not waste time working on something inferior. In the case of an architect or engineer, I can see checking to see if the creative character produced a work with flaws, but in the case of a painter, sculptor, poet, or musician, what is good or bad should be relative to the individual or group sampling the work.`,
            answer: [
                `You're putting too much emphasis on the "naturally accomplished" phrase. The proficiency description's second sentence explains what being "natural accomplished" means: The character understands color, form, space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. While these are the fundamental building blocks of artistic expression, not every character understands them to the same extent, and not every character can consistently translate this knowledge into a successful work of art. Everywhere, there are marginally talented authors and artists who believe they'd be famous if only the public could appreciate them, but that's putting the cart before the horse. When an artist botches the job and produces a piece of junk, it's the artist who has failed, not the viewer.`,
                `I suppose a DM could assume that abstract art has made its appearance in the world. While it is true that only people who understand the "language" of such art can fully appreciate it, the artist still must successfully apply his knowledge to create a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing work. In this case, the viewer might indeed have to make an ability check to understand the work, but this does not free the artist from his obligation to do a good job in the first place.`

            question: `I am so disgusted with all the good represented in the AD&D game. Why is there no place in any of the various worlds for evil characters? Even the RAVENLOFT™ setting doesn't really allow for evil player characters. The staff at TSR really needs to realize that the Demiplane of Dread is not the kind of place where paladins and their moms bring PCs glasses of cold milk and plates of warm brownies! The AD&D game's melodramatic theme has made me sick one too many times. Can we look forward to a change soon?`,
            answer: [
                `TSR's products assume the PCs will be the good guys, so you are mostly correct when you point out that there is no place in any of the published worlds for evil PCs. You're "almost" correct, because any AD&D game world needs evil nonplayer characters to provide threat and conflict for the PCs. Completely safe worlds are pretty boring, as you can't have heroic player characters without suitably nasty villains to oppose them.`,
                `I also assure you that nobody at TSR, Inc. believes that paladins in the RAVENLOFT setting have time to serve cookies and brownies. They're far too busy trying to keep the various lords from obliterating the innocent and snatching unsuspecting travelers off their home planes.`,
                `Your simplistic view of good people as superficial wimps is curiously similar to the attitude most 20th-century megalomaniacs have shown to the world. In the 1930s, the Fascists in Germany and Italy and the Militarists in Japan had exactly this view of the western democracies. By 1945, however, everybody understood just how tough those democracies really were.`,
                `The struggle between good and evil is what drives the AD&D game. It is possible for the PCs to be the bad guys; however, TSR products assume the PCs will be good for several reasons. First, the game's basic structure requires PCs to work together as a group; each character class has inherent strengths and weaknesses that make them very well prepared to handle some situations but unprepared to handle other kinds of problems. The only way to overcome these gaps in capability is to work with other characters who have different sets of skills. The staff at TSR knows from experience that it is much easier-and a lot more fun-to put together an effective party of good and neutral characters than to try and hold together a group of evil characters.`,
                `A party of good characters will share a commitment to a common moral or ethical precept. Evil characters, on the other hand, tend to be concerned with preserving themselves. This concept of self varies with the character's actual alignment. The self could be an entity free to do exactly what it wants regardless of the larger consequences (chaotic evil); it could be, an entity uniquely qualified to survive the rigors of existence (neutral evil); or it could be a part of a larger structure that defines all existence (lawful evil). Nonetheless, each character's primary motivation is essentially selfish.`,
                `Consequently, the types of bonds that hold these groups together are vastly different. Good guys depend on friendship, trust, and altruism to keep themselves going. This helps keep campaigns going, too, since each players share in the group's successes. Since role-playing is a social activity, it helps when all the players and their characters are at least civil to each other. Evil groups stay together mainly through intimidation and deceit. This tends to destroy campaigns because players get tired of being fooled or bullied. Success, if there is any at all, belongs only to the player who comes out on top in each session.`,
                `In the short term, both types of groups can get by; in the long term, good groups develop common goals and accomplish great things together. Evil groups stay focused on the short-term goal of survival and don't get anywhere. If you do manage to reach a point of equilibrium where a powerful evil PC can control the other PCs, you'll find that the other players quickly will lose interest—nobody likes to play the fool or the doormat for long. Also, players can keep their game feelings separated from their real feelings for only so long. Sooner or later, the hostilities that arise between evil characters are going to arise between the players, and good-bye campaign. The only way I know to avoid this when your PCs are evil is to structure your games like skirmish war games, not heroic quests. This is fine if skirmish war games are what you want to play. You certainly could play a long-term campaign in the RAVENLOFT setting where each evil PC controls his own domain. Again, this type game of will become a long-term political and military campaign, not a role-playing campaign.`,
                `In a role-playing campaign, good guys tend to make a lot more interesting characters than bad guys. Bad guys don't struggle with the larger issues, and they remain unconcerned with the ethical implications of what they're doing. As a result, the player has less to think about and just plain less to do if he has an evil character. Bad guys don't last as long as good guys. When the party gets lost in the wilderness and food runs out, a good party pools its resources and tries to figure out how to feed everybody; a group of starving bad guys eventually begins stealing each other's food or even goes to work deciding how best to eat each other. The party infighting that arises among evil characters also increase the PC mortality rate. Not only will evil characters occasionally kill each other, but they often will allow their comrades to die unnecessarily. Such losses impair the group's ability to withstand further adversity. Of course, an evil character can disingenuously choose to use others to help him survive; however, this parasitic approach doesn't work in a role-playing campaign. If the character doesn't succumb to greed and turn predatory, the PCs he's taking advantage of eventually will notice what's really happening. In real life, people trapped in an evil person's orbit might not be able to break free, but players in a game always can just quit (and they often do).`,
                `An AD&D campaign with good PCs doesn't have to be melodramatic. Characters, at least occasionally, should have to labor long and hard to conclude an adventure. Along the way, they can face a few thorny ethical problems and be forced to choose between unpleasant alternatives. If the action in your games is sappy, it's because there's not enough creative energy going into the storytelling, not because the PCs are good. Be very careful when considering evil PCs. Many DMs, especially younger ones, don't have a clear idea of what evil is and what being evil costs. Evil, by definition, is that which causes ruin, injury, or pain. The good and evil alignments in the AD&D game are not rival clubs or gangs. Good people stick together because they have a moral and ethical inclination to do so. Evil characters don't hang together. Unlike good characters, they don't have a common point of reference. They also don't have to observe proprieties or sacrifice their own desires for the sake of goodness. They pay for these privileges by losing the trust and confidence of their companions and the ability to trust others. To an evil being, everyone and everything is a potential enemy, even after a peaceable meeting.`,
                `Since good characters tend to promote healthy, long-running campaigns, and evil characters tend to break up gaming groups, you can expect TSR's products to continue casting the good guys at center stage. If you decide to ignore all of the foregoing and try evil PCs, I wish you luck. At worst, you'll give up the game in disgust. At best, you'll learn a little bit about what makes the game tick. Either way, you'll get an education.`

Too many players and DMs spend their time and energy worrying about getting the rules "right" and not nearly enough time on telling an entertaining story, presenting and responding to intellectual challenges, and creating believable characters that players care about. People who call TSR to settle local rules disputes deserve what they get. Like everything else in a well-run campaign, the DM and players can hurt the game by applying the rules too loosely or too stringently. Campaigns that ignore the rules quickly spin out of control; player characters get too much power or can't get enough power. Either case makes adventuring a futile exercise. Likewise, the DM and players cannot make intelligent game decisions unless they have some idea of what the results of some particular action will be. The rules are there as a tool for channeling the action in a creative and entertaining direction. On the other hand, the rules are supposed to promote play, not restrict it; a role-playing game is supposed to be a heroic adventure, not an exercise in legal argument.`,

Does this new way of reading the rules grant a PC or monster a world-beating way to use a spell or bit of equipment? Is this particular choice of skills and equipment obviously superior to all other combinations of powers available in the game? Will this new rule place a PC or monster in the kind of ridiculous position that only a complete fool would get into?

In any case, alchemy is too complex to be covered in a single proficiency. I suppose a true alchemist might have nonweapon proficiencies in Brewing, Astrology, Herbalism, Mineralogy, Spellcraft, Engineering, and, optionally, Pottery or Glassblowing (a previously undescribed proficiency).

In fact, since Water Find does not allow a character to rehydrate, it's pretty clear that the character usually finds something less than a full day's supply. As for giving away any water found, there's no reason to assume the character actually finds drinkable water; the proficiency might yield just a trickle of liquid water and several mouthfuls of soggy cactus pulp. While half-giants and thri-kreen might be able to choke down many different forms of nonliquid water, not every character can. I suggest that you place some limit on the amount of water actually available for sharing, say 1d4 + 1 pints.

For example, a character with the wild talent of Domination gets 27 PSPs for that power (3 PSPs is the minimum cost to use the power once, plus the minimum maintenance cost of 6 PSPs, times four). If the character has more than one power, he gets the full allotment of PSPs for *each* power. That is, determine how many PSPs the character would get for each power, then add them together to get the character's actual PSP total.

A change in alignment is optional and occurs only when the DM and the player agree that the prevailing circumstances make it possible. In other words, a player with a half-giant character should consider what has happened to the character each day and decide if the character's alignment should shift. If, for example, the predominately good party the character has been adventuring with falls into a squabble over water or treasure, the DM and the player might decide it's time to shift the half-giant's alignment toward the chaotic or evil end of the spectrum.

                `As "Sage Advice" pointed out in issue #178, spelljammers cannot reach Athas. Exactly why this is so is unrevealed, but the prevailing theory is that Athas is not located inside a crystal sphere but on an alternate Prime Material plane where spelljamming devices don't work.`,
                `I suspect that wildspacefaring characters would not find Athas a welcoming place at any rate. While common folk might not be any more suspicious of spacefarers than they are of any other strangers, sorcerer-kings are a different matter. Once these tyrants realize what spelljamming is and what it can do, they're going to ruthlessly attack, not giving up until the spacefarers flee the planet or are killed or enslaved. (Of course, such an attack could begin disguised as a friendly overture.) A single spelljamming ship, even at atmospheric speeds, would be an invaluable fighting and exploration platform on Athas. No sorcerer-king would allow one to exist unless it was firmly under his control.`,
                `Since preserver magic uses the same rules as "normal" magic, I think it's safe to assume that a plane-hopping wizard who finds himself on Athas would have preserver spells. I suppose such a wizard could learn the local "shortcuts" and become a defiler, but that's up to the DM.`

            question: `What exactly does a ***rope of entanglement*** do? Are victims automatically ensnared and rendered helpless until freed or killed? Is an attack roll required? Does the victim get a saving throw? What is the rope's maximum area of effect?`,
            answer: [
                `The current rules seem to leave the exact effects up in the air, as the description in the AD&D 2nd Edition ***Dungeon Master's Guide*** (page 179) does not mention any game effects at all. The AD&D 1st Edition ***DMG*** isn't much more helpful, but it does include the phase "entangle and tie fast" (page 153). It's pretty clear to me that the intent behind this item is to allow the wielder to at least immobilize opponents and probably to restrict their attacks.`,
                `Judging from the description in the 1st Edition ***DMG***, I'm inclined to think that a ***rope of entanglement*** prevents its victims from moving normally (i.e., no walking, running, jumping, burrowing, or flying with wings) but does not prevent magical movement such as ***levitation*** or ***fly*** spells. Humans and demihumans who use their limbs to swim are immobilized and will sink if ensnared in the rope; however, fish and similar creatures probably still could swim through open water at half or two-thirds speed, as their streamlined bodies and tiny fins really can't be effectively tangled. On the other hand, even a fish or ***levitating*** creature can be held in place if there are weeds or other suitable objects the rope can grab along with the victim. For example, a wizard flying through a forest might be immobilized when the rope wraps him up along with the branch- es of an oak tree.`,
                `For purposes of game balance, I suggest that a creature entwined in a ***rope of entanglement*** be allowed to make melee attacks at a -4 penalty, but only against the rope or opponents who are directly adjacent to the entwined victim. Missile attacks are generally not possible while entwined, but the DM might allow them under special circumstances; a manticore's tail spikes might still be effective, for example, as might a giant porcupine's quills. An entwined victim might manage to fire a loaded and cocked crossbow that was already pointed at a target when the rope struck. Such attacks also should suffer the same -4 penalty to attack rolls that melee attacks get.`,
                `In any case, no attack rolls are required to use this item. The wielder can direct the rope at any opponent within range (20' horizontally and 10' vertically). The targets are automatically entwined in the rope, with no saving throw allowed, provided they fit within the size limits specified in the item's description. Common sense suggests that the rope's "downward' range (the distance within which it can be used if it is dropped from a height) could be more than 10', but probably not more than 20'.`,
                `Common sense also suggests that the rope cannot affect creatures in a total area more than about 40' long by 5' deep (this is the distance a line of eight man-sized creatures will occupy if they line up shoulder-to-shoulder with enough space between to allow for normal melee). In other words, the rope's maximum area of effect is 200 square feet, and its maximum "length of effect" 40'. Note that I'm assuming a ***rope of entanglement*** is 50' long, as this is the "standard" length for a rope in the AD&D game and it seems to jive with the rope's basic "capacity" of eight man-sized creatures (the "missing" 10' of the rope's length is used up as it coils around its victims).`

            question: `Please clarify the effects of magic resistance in the following situations: 1) Someone casts a ***wall of stone*** spell so that it falls on top of the magic-resistant creature; 2) A drow (an elven race that has magic resistance and suffers various penalties in bright light) is enveloped in a ***light*** or ***continual light*** spell; and 3) A magic-resistant marine creature that breathes only water finds itself within an ***airy water*** spell.`,
            answer: [
                `"Sage Advice" discussed magic resistance in issue #175 (page 76), but it seems to be time to study the subject in more detail. Most of these answers are pretty straightforward; a little common sense and a careful rereading of the magic-resistance rules (***PH***, pages 102-103; ***DMG***, page 66-67) should put these matters to rest. When adjudicating the effects, if any, of magic resistance, the DM has to consider two factors. First, what type of magic is involved? The rules make four distinctions: individually targeted spells, area-effect spells, in-place spells, and permanent spells. Second, does the "incoming" magic directly affect the magic-resistant creature, or is the effect on the creature merely a consequence of the magic being there? Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules (beyond what's already printed in the books) to decide which conditions apply. Here's my reasoning:`,
                `1) A ***wall of stone*** is a permanent magical effect (its duration is so listed in the spell description). Furthermore, magical "wall" spells are evocations, which directly bring forth or create their effects. When the ***wall of stone*** falls on top of a magic-resistant creature, or even if the creature tries to walk through a stationary wall, the magical effect is acting directly on the creature. Magic resistance applies; if the magic-resistance roll succeeds, the creature passes harmlessly through the wall. Since the ***wall of stone*** is permanent, there is no effect on it; that is, the wall is not dispelled or pierced with a hole that other creatures can pass through.`,
                `2) ***Light*** and ***continual light*** spells are a little harder to figure out. Both are in-place effects, operating continuously in a particular place or on a particular item. However, ***continual light*** also is permanent, and both spells can be cast directly against a creature to blind it. When used to blind a creature, either of these spells is treated as an individually targeted effect, and magic-resistance applies. Since the caster is targeting a single creature only when trying to blind an opponent with either spell, the effect is completely negated if the magic-resistance roll succeeds (as it is for any area-effect spell targeted solely at the magic-resistant creature).`,
                `However, an entirely different set of circumstances prevails when a magic-resistant creature moves into or otherwise finds itself inside either spells area of effect. Both spells are alterations, magic that works a change on a creature, area, or object, and this change produces the spells effects. In the case of ***light*** and ***continual light***, these spells change an area or object so that it emits light. One explanation of how this works is that the atoms in the area of effect are excited so that they emit visible light. The light has a central focus (so the light can be hidden by an opaque container), but it is the target object or area that emits the light, not the spell. Since the magic affects the area and not the creature, magic resistance does not apply (the light is a consequence of the spell). The same holds true for the reverse of these spells; a creature might be very badly affected by ***darkness*** or ***continual darkness***, but, since the magic doesn't directly affect the creature, magic resistance is irrelevant.`,
                `3. ***Airy water*** also is an in-place spell, but it is also an alteration that affects an area, not the creatures within the area.`,

            question: `In issue #169, you said a fighter/thief must use his thief
            THAC0 and cannot get specialization bonuses when backstabbing. But the ***PH***, page 45 says: "A multi-classed warrior can use all of his abilities without restriction. The warrior abilities form the base for other character classes." Page 45 also says multiclassed characters can combine class abilities, in direct contradiction to what "Sage Advice" said in issue #169. Did you make a brainographical error (to quote game designer Aaron Allston) or are you playing the "Skip's AD&D" game, in which DM interpretations override rules? If so, my friends and I will ignore your column in the future and ask DRAGON Magazine to run a disclaimer stating that your column does not follow the books.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding "combining" multi-classed abilities: The word "combine," as used on page 45 of the ***PH***, is meant to convey the fact that the character can freely use his abilities during a single encounter or adventure without penalty, as opposed to dual-classed characters, who can suffer experience penalties if they fall back on their old class abilities too soon. It is not meant to convey that a multi-classed character can use abilities from two or more classes simultaneously.`,
                `Regarding fighter/thief backstabs: The TSR house ruling—not the "Skip" ruling—on this matter is that the character must use his thief THAC0. You have quoted page 45 accurately, but the rules contradict themselves here. Two of a fighter's most important "abilities" are unrestricted weapon and armor use, and these are severely curtailed in several multi-classed combinations: fighter/wizards are prohibited from wearing most metal armor, fighter/clerics can't use edged weapons, and fighter/thieves can't wear metal armor without reductions to thief abilities. This is hardly unrestricted use of fighter abilities. The TSR staff's concern here is for game balance. The thief's backstab ability can do pretty darn hefty damage, and generally it is best for the campaign if a backstab attempt fails once in awhile.`,
                `Still, the letter of the rules supports your view. So does game logic; if thieves carefully study anatomy and learn to place their attacks so as to inflict maximum damage, it stands to reason that fighter abilities might allow them to hit an opponent's "soft spots" more easily. This particular conundrum won't be officially cleared up until that far-off day when an AD&D 3rd Edition comes out. Until then, I suggest you either follow the advice given in issue #169 or allow fighter/thieves to use their fighter THAC0 when backstabbing, but only with the standard +2 rear attack bonus. For purposes of game balance, the +4 bonus and fighter THAC0 is just too tough a combination for the campaign's bad-guy NPCs to withstand. From the standpoint of game logic, the training in precise blows a thief learns while perfecting the backstab (a highly favorable situation for the attacker) overlaps the fighter's generally superior training in the use of weapons in all situations.`,

            question: `In issue #179, you said that ***magic missile*** was a spell attack, and that the only effect a ***cloak of displacement*** had on spell attacks is a saving throw bonus. Since ***magic missile*** has no save, you said, there is no effect. Well, the spell description says that the spell produces "missiles" and that the target must be seen or detected to be hit. A displaced creature is really somewhere other than where a viewer thinks it is. When a spell caster targets a displaced creature, he's really just aiming at empty air. The creature wearing the cloak is actually unseen, as the cloak creates a sort of ***mirror image*** that is some distance from the wearer's actual location. Since ***magic missile*** doesn't work on inanimate objects, it is wasted in this case.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding ***cloaks of displacement*** and ***magic missiles***: I stand by my answer in issue #179. A ***magic missile*** is a spell attack (the number of times the word "missile" appears in the spell description notwithstanding) that always hits, *displaced* target or no. A *displaced* creature is neither invisible nor replaced by an illusory double. The cloak distorts other creatures' visual perceptions of the wearer's location. A wizard may very well be "aiming at empty air" when casting ***magic missiles*** at a *displaced* creature, but the spell compensates for the error and hits anyway. The spell description does require that the caster see the target, and a *displaced* creature is still visible, even if the viewer isn't sure exactly where the creature is.`,
                `The situation is analogous to what happens when you look at an object underwater from above the surface. The physical refraction (bending) of light as it passes from air to water makes the object appear to be in a different place. In the case of a displaced creature, the margin of error is 1'-2'. In either case, the viewer sees the object. The visual distortion caused by a ***cloak of displacement*** does not make the cloaks wearer immune to spells. For example, ***charm person*** and ***charm monster*** spells also cannot affect objects, but when cast at a *displaced* creature these spells don't dissipate into "empty air." The *displaced* target gets a +2 saving-throw bonus but still is vulnerable to the spell cast at him.`,
                `As an aside, a colleague of mine at TSR also considered my reply on this question in issue #179, and his comment was that I was being too generous when I suggested that a ***cloak of displacement*** might grant a save against ***magic missiles***. In his view, a ***cloak of displacement*** has no effect on ***magic missiles*** at all. TSR's Jon Pickens did point out, however, that the cloaks saving-throw bonus would be cumulative with a ***scarab of protection***, which does grant a save vs. spells such as ***magic missile***, which normally allow no save.`,

This directly contradicts the ***polymorph other*** spell description, which clearly states that the creature gains the natural armor class and "purely physical" abilities of the assumed form. You also suggest that the tarrasque could keep the sharpness ability of its bite. While this is a magical ability, a bunny's skeletal structure is hardly the same as that of the *un-polymorphed* tarrasque. In short, the tarrasque would be a 300-hp bunny with the saving throws of a 70-HD monster, and that's all.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding *polymorphing* the tarrasque into a bunny: The victim of a ***polymorph other*** spell is stuck with the natural armor class of the new form; I goofed on this one. Nevertheless, the tarrasque is legendarily tough and keeps its armor class even when *polymorphed* into a bunny, amoeba, or anything else that doesn't have an armor class better than -3. The point I was trying to make in issue #180 is that the tarrasque is a near-deity-class creature that is all but invulnerable in any form. Note that regeneration is not dependent on a creature's outer form and *any* naturally regenerating creature—whether a tarrasque, troll, vampire, or whatever—still regenerates when *polymorphed*. Other forms of the tarrasque's special defenses-including immunity to heat and fire, and returning to life unless reduced to -30 hp and ***wished*** dead, remain when it is in bunny form. However, I forgot to mention in issue #180 that the tarrasque's ability to reflect beams and rays specifically depends on the creature's carapace, and this ability disappears if the creature is in "bunny form."`,
                `Regarding the tarrasque's ***teeth of sharpness***: There are two things you obviously haven't seen: the size and sharpness of a large rabbit's front incisors, which can do nasty things to errant fingers, and the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, in which a vorpal bunny wreaks havoc on King Arthur and his knights. The movie isn't part of the game, but I couldn't help thinking of the vorpal bunny scene when I was writing the column. You have a good point in that bunny teeth really aren't the limb-severing type. Still, the tarrasque is a power unto itself. I encourage DMs to ride herd on any group of PCs foolish enough to tackle the tarrasque, and limb-severing tarrasque/bunny bites are fine with me so long as they are fine with the DM.`,

The AD&D game's one-minute combat rounds make individual quickness much less important than the character's defensive value and general class of actions; that's why things like weapon speed factors and spell-casting times do affect initiative. Of course, DMs are free to add their own house rules incorporating reaction modifiers. The simplest way is to just subtract the modifier from the die roll. If you do this, I strongly suggest the DM take a long look at the monsters that populate the campaign and assign a reaction modifiers to some of the quicker beasts; otherwise, the PCs are going to win initiative far too often.`,

First, while it's fine to assume that a creature automatically steps into a door created beneath it, it doesn't have to be so. The DM is free to allow the creature a save to avoid "falling in," or the DM can decide that a creature never falls in and is just displaced onto safe ground instead.`,
                `Second, there's nothing in the description that suggests creatures passing through the door suffer damage of any kind, Any creature entering one door automatically appears at the other one, and vice versa. This movement is instantaneous and interdimensional. This is not the same as falling or running an equivalent distance; the creature does not gain any velocity or kinetic energy, it appears at the other door just as if it used a ***teleport*** or ***dimension door*** spell to go from one door to the other. Note that a creature falling 60' into one door probably will suffer 6d6 hp damage when coming out the other door, as the dimension between the doors doesn't reduce kinetic energy or velocity any more that it increases it.`,
                `Note also that one of the two doors the psionicist creates appears *in front of the psionicist* (the description does not say how close, but I suggest from 1" to 5' at the psionicist's option), and one pretty much wherever the psionicist wants it. This means that if the psionicist wants to create a door immediately underneath a foe, he'd better be ready for a fight.`

            question: `Psychokinetic devotions seem impossible to get. Every psycho- kinetic devotion has Telekinesis as a prerequisite, which is a science. You must have twice as many devotions in a discipline as you have sciences, so to add a psychokinetic devotion to your repertoire you'd have to add Telekinesis and two devotions. The only time you get to add a science and two devotions (according to the table in the ***CPH***, page 12) is when you go from 2nd to 3rd level. However, you also are not allowed to have as many sciences or devotions in a discipline as you have in your primary discipline, and at 3rd level you only get two sciences. You can't just pick up Telekinesis alone, then add devotions later, because you must always have at least twice as many devotions in a discipline as you have sciences. Am I misunderstanding something, or is there a problem here? The difficulty could be solved by adding a psychokinetic devotion or two that does not have Telekinesis as a prerequisite.`,
            answer: [
                `Actually, there are several psychokinetic powers that don't require Telekinesis: Animate Shadow, Control Light, Control Sound, Molecular Agitation, Soften, and, of course, Telekinesis. This is an official piece of errata that was included with the DARK SUN™ boxed set.

                `Even so, if psychokinesis isn't your character's primary discipline, it's pretty rough to add Telekinesis to your psionicist's bag of tricks. This difficulty is not limited to psychokinesis. Since you can never have as many sciences or devotions in a secondary discipline as in the primary discipline, the additional science earned at 3rd level *must* be in the primary discipline, no matter what the primary is. This is deliberate. Learning psionic powers is an orderly process that does not allow the character to jump willy-nilly between disciplines. That's why psionicists must be lawful. No psionicist has the mental wherewithal to become a dilettante. Psionicists aren't meant to plunge headlong into new devotions—they explore them slowly and deliberately.`,

            question: `What happens if a character with a wild talent decides to become a psionicist? Does he add all his PSPs together? Do his wild talents count as prerequisites for new powers? Do wild talents count toward the characters limits on disciplines, devotions, and sciences?`,
            answer: [
                `All the rules on dual-classed characters in the ***PH***, page 45, apply. The character temporarily sets aside his wild talents and sets out to study how psychic powers really work. (Note that most DMs probably wouldn't make a character set aside wild talents if the dual-classed character was picking up any other class except psionicist, since wild talents have nothing to do with any character class, but this is a special case.) The character gains a separate pool of wild-talent PSPs and powers, and he cannot use powers or PSPs from this pool without giving up experience as described in the ***PH***. The wild talents do not affect the types of psionic powers the character can learn; they are locked away in a separate part of the character's mind, just like all the other class abilities the character has chosen to ignore for the moment.`,
                `As soon as the character's psionicist level exceeds his old character-class level, he theoretically has access to his old character abilities and wild talents. However, he also still must abide by all the restrictions of the psionicist class. The simplest way to handle this is just to assume that the character has a few rogue powers and a pool of PSPs to support them. Such powers would never count against the numerical limits on the psionicist's powers or be used as prerequisites for other powers. However, the DM might allow the character to integrate his wild talents into his list of psionicist powers. This should not be a problem if the character does not exceed the number of disciplines he normally is allowed, and if he does not exceed the number of different kinds of sciences and devotions he can have within those disciplines. That is, the character can have "bonus" sciences and devotions but not extra disciplines, and the total number of devotions and sciences he has in his primary discipline still sets a limit on the number of sciences and devotions he can have outside the primary discipline (the primary discipline is the first discipline chosen when the character is a 1st-level psionicist). Proper play balance requires that the character's total number of disciplines remain unchanged and that the ratio between powers inside and outside the primary discipline be maintained. The effects of lifting these limits would be something like letting wizards and priests choose their daily spells as they need them instead of studying or praying for them in advance.`,
                `The character should be able to make free use (for purposes of prerequisites, PSP expenditure, and otherwise) of any power that does not violate the limits. For example, a character with a Mind Bar wild talent could choose telepathy as his primary discipline and have free access to the power, since Mind Bar is a telepathic devotion. (The total number of devotions within a primary discipline is limited only by the psionicist's level. In this case, Mind Bar is a "bonus" power.) Powers that exceed the limits must remain separate; for example, a character whose primary discipline is psychometabolism might not have "room" for Mind Bar, since the number of nonpsychometabolic devotions he can have is limited to at least one less than the number of psychometabolic devotions he has. So long as the character has even one excess power, his wild talent PSPs can be expended only to establish and maintain wild talents (and PSPs gained from the character's psionicist level cannot be spent on such rogue powers). If the character has a power both as a wild talent and as a psionicist's power, he should be allowed to merge the two and gain a point on his power score. Likewise, if the character manages to fit all his wild talents into his limits, he should be allowed to add his wild-talent PSPs to his psionicist total. The easiest way for the character to do this would be to choose a primary discipline that includes his wild-talent powers.`

            question: `The text and illustrations in ***The Arms and Equipment Guide*** identify a morning star as a kind of club with a spiked head. I always thought a morning star was one or more balls attached to a short handle by a chain or chains, but ***The Arms and Equipment Guide*** describes that kind of weapon as a flail. Also, where is the mace entry on the Master Weapons Chart?`,
            answer: [
                `In both versions of the AD&D game, a morning star is a big club with a spiked or ridged head, something like a hardwood baseball bat with a lot of large nails driven into the business end. That also is the definition given in every reputable treatise on medieval weapons I've ever read.`,
                `A flail, in the AD&D game and anywhere else where an accurate nomenclature of medieval weapons is used, is a weapon with the business end separated from the handle by a chain or other flexible joint. The ball, chain, and short-handle version is called a horseman's flail in the AD&D game. Another common form of flail is a long handle with a big club attached to the end by a very short length of chain; this is called a footman's flail in the ADD game. Flails of all kinds are the direct descendants of agricultural flails used to thresh grain; before the Industrial Revolution, the only way to separate grains of wheat, oats, rice, etc. from their stalks was to pile up the harvested plants and literally beat (thresh) them. The extra "snap" provided by the flails jointed head allowed the farmer to hit the pile of grain with more force and get the job done faster.`,
                `Both morning stars and flails were mainstays of the common folks weaponry because they were easy to make and use. No commoner—certainly no farmer—would ever mistake one for the other. I personally have never seen a flail improperly identified as a morning star in print, but I have met a lot of people who apparently have. I've also met people who confuse flails for maces, probably because they both can have round heads studded with spikes. If using an alternate nomenclature for medieval weapons makes you happy, fine, but when you're playing the AD&D game use the game nomenclature to avoid confusion.`,
                `[Webster's Third New International Dictionary *(Unabridged, 1986) describes a morning star as "a weapon consisting of a heavy ball set with spikes and either attached to a staff or suspended from one by a chain-called also holy-water sprinkler" (page 1471). "Holy water sprinkler" is used as an alternate name for the morning star in both the 1st Edition **PH** (page 37) and **AEG** (pages 82-83). Obviously, some confusion on this matter exists even among authorities. — Editor]*`,

            question: `In the RAVENLOFT® setting, will a paladin or good cleric lose his special class abilities if he fails a Ravenloft powers check? If a ***resurrection*** or ***raise dead*** spell fails and instead turns the target into an undead, would the spell-caster have to make a powers check? If so, why? Isn't casting one of these spells a good act? Is there any way to remove the stages and effects of failed powers checks?`,
            answer: [
                `First, take another look at the altered spell descriptions for ***raise dead*** (***Realm of Terror***, page 44) and ***resurrection*** (***RT***, page 45), and you'll find that each of these spells requires a powers check if they succeed or not. Bringing the dead back to life sends ripples through the Demi-plane of Dread. No matter what the spell-caster's intention, plucking a being out of the afterlife and returning him to the lands of the living is an event that the powers of Ravenloft always find interesting. It is true that powers checks are intended to start evil PCs down the road to ruin, but anyone who tampers with fate or with other basic forces in the multiverse while adventuring in Ravenloft takes the same risk.`,
                `When a character first fails a powers check, the powers of Ravenloft essentially invite the PC to become one of their own "part of the furniture," as TSR's Jon Pickens puts it. A stage-one failure is a subtle enticement that shouldn't give the PC any obvious clues about what's really going on. When paladin or cleric abilities disappear, the character is getting a strong clue that he's started down the wrong path. Also, as you point out, you can fail a powers check by doing things that would be considered good deeds anywhere else. Since powers checks are intended to punish players who wander off the straight-and-narrow path of heroic fantasy, play balance and overall campaign health dictates that the DM allow characters to redeem themselves once they've gone astray. For the moment, DMs are on their own when deciding how and when a character properly atones. However the upcoming ***Forbidden Lore*** boxed set, available in November and previewed in POLYHEDRON® Newszine issue #74, has extensive new material on powers checks.`,
                `Here are some suggestions until something better comes along: At the minimum, a character who wishes to reverse the results of a failed check should act scrupulously good. If the character has taken any special vows or represents a particular system of beliefs (a paladin, for example), his new behavior must absolutely embody the tenets of his sect or order. Furthermore, the character should avoid making use of the rewards and enticements a failed check brings. It might be hard to avoid using a +1 saving-throw bonus, but in such cases I suggest the DM allow it, especially if the character role-plays the attempt to give up the bonus ("Yeah, I know Bruce Bonecruncher gained a +1 bonus on fear checks after wrecking that altar, but he really looks long and hard at the swarm of killer bees just to be sure he has the gumption to stand up to them."). Of course, an ***atonement*** and a suitable quest should reduce or remove the effects of a failed powers check. So might a simple ***remove curse***, especially if the character has left the demi-plane or has spent some time actively resisting the powers. For a stage one failure, I suggest one month as the minimum period of atonement.`,

                `This is a design/editorial error, as the core rules for the AD&D 2nd Edition game don't list any monetary values for magical items. The upcoming ***Magical Encyclopedia*** does list a gold-piece value for just about every item ever created in the AD&D game (volume one, of two, will be available this fall). Gold-piece values, however, are even higher than experience values, and a starting witch probably could afford to "buy" only a single cursed item or a useful potion or two. This is because the witch is supposed to have an old item or two just left laying around from the old days, not so that she can have a leg up on everybody else in the magical-treasure department. As a rule of thumb, an item's monetary value is three to seven times its xp value (usually five times), and most cursed items usually are worth 100 gp (for potions) to 1,000 gp (for miscellaneous magic).`,

                `First, wild magic is not a school; it is a chaotic magical force and a method of studying magic that capitalizes on that chaos.

Various game mechanics that make use of spell schools work normally in regard to priest and wild-magic spells. For example, a ***detect magic*** spell can be used to determine a spell's school, which in turn reveals clues about what the spell is doing and how it might affect an adventure. Likewise, a specialist wizard who receives a bonus or penalty to saving throws against spells of a particular school gets that bonus or penalty even if the spell in question is a wild magic spell or priest spell.`,

I must take exception to this. To my mind, multiclassed fighter/thieves are just as "accustomed" to heavy armor as are bards. The reduced penalties should apply to both types of characters or to neither. I would say to neither, since only dexterity should mitigate the noise, stiffness, and bulk of these types of armor and the ***PHB*** already allows for dexterity adjustments.`,
            answer: [
                `As "Sage Advice" has pointed out before, the Complete Handbooks contain *optional* rules for altering your campaign's scope and focus. Don't waste time taking exception to anything you find in them—just don't use the rules you dislike. As always, you'll have to use common sense when picking and choosing rules, but you never have to use all the rules in a "Complete Handbook!' I think you can still get pretty good use out of ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** even if you don't allow bards reduced penalties for wearing armor.`,
                `I think you've really opened a can of worms by suggesting that fighter/thieves might be entitled to the reduced armor penalties in the ***The Complete Bard's Handbook***, even if you immediately reject the idea yourself. I suppose that it isn't much of a leap to extend this benefit to multiclassed fighter/thieves once a DM decides his campaign's play balance isn't going to fly out the window if he allows bards the reduced penalties. Why stop at just multiclassed fighter/thieves? After all, dual-classed fighter/thieves know even more about armor and how to function when wearing it than any other kind of thief—they've had training as pure fighters. Then again, what about thief kits like the adventurer, bandit, bounty hunter, scout, and thug? Thieves with these kits—especially thugs-can expect combat and probably learn something about armor, too. There are two big reasons ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** suggests reduced thieving penalties for heavy armor.`,
                `First, bards in the AD&D 2nd Edition game are true dilettantes, jacks of all trades. This generalization goes beyond what multi- and dual-classed characters do. Bards don't learn a whole lot about anything, but they learn a little bit about everything, and this makes them intrinsically more adaptable than dual- or multi-classed characters.`,
                `Second, ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** is specifically designed to give bards a boost. It's for DMs who want to run all-bard campaigns or at least want to encourage more players to choose bards. Many bard advocates complain, perhaps rightly, that the core rules for bards in the AD&D 2nd Edition game produce weak, unplayable characters. Certainly, a multi-classed fighter/thief has access to more thief skills and fighter weapons than a bard has. The fighter/thief probably also has a better THAC0 as well. Many people think that a bards few spells and special abilities hardly make up for all this. The reduced armor penalties attempt to redress this.`

Beyond this, deciding what to accept as a new psionic power involves the same process of analysis and individual judgment that introducing a new spell does.`,
                `When working with spells, you limit power and player abuse by assigning spell levels, components, and sometimes side effects to the caster. When dealing with psionic powers, you assign PSP costs for establishment and maintenance, prerequisites, power scores, possibly limitations on the number of times the power can be used, and the possibility of catastrophic failure (those neat things that plague the character when the power check roll is a natural 20).`,
                `Generally, it's best to decide what discipline the proposed power will fall under, then compare its suggested effects with other powers in the discipline to decide whether it will be a devotion or a science-more potent powers should be classed as sciences. Likewise, the more "oomph" the power has, the worse (lower) its power score should be. Again, use other powers as a guideline. In the end, the DM must use his own judgment; pay particular attention to the "Analyzing a Spell" section on page 43 of the ***DMG***, and be prepared to do some troubleshooting.`

I'd allow +1 weapons and creatures hit only by magical weapons to do half damage, and enchanted weapons with a +2 bonus or higher and ethereal creatures to do full damage. Energy attacks (particularly cold-based attacks), gaze weapons ("Oh, there's a medusa, I wonder what ectoplasmic stone looks like?"), and spells and psionic attacks that affect the mind still pose a danger to the ectoplasmic character. Also remember that a full round of uninterrupted preparation is necessary to use this power. The character's fellow PCs also can deal with the character when he finally assumes normal form ("Darn it!

Can a psionic power be maintained or initiated while a spell-caster is maintaining a spell that requires concentration?`,
            answer: [
                `A psionicist can maintain a previously initiated power no matter what else he does in a round, provided that he has the PSPs to pay the maintenance cost, and provided that the power in question can be maintained. Once a power is "switched on," maintaining that power does not require concentration and does not count as an action for the psionicist. Maintaining a power does not interfere with combat, spell-casting, initiating a new psionic power, or other activities. Of course, if the psionicist loses consciousness or dies, he cannot continue to maintain a power.`,

Obviously, some maintained powers *do* require concentration as well as PSP expenditure. For example, the Telepathic devotion ESP allows the user to read minds. While the rules (***CPHB***, page 14) allow the power to be maintained without effort, common sense suggests that actually reading a mind would keep the psionicist occupied. If he does something else (such as launch an attack), he still can maintain the power but reads no thoughts that round.`,

A regenerating creature also eventually will recover from the effects of disease and poison. In all these cases, the DM should assign a hit-point value to the condition to see how long it takes the creature to regenerate back to full health and vigor.`,

The DM will have to decide exactly what the results are when this happens. For example, a successful ***dispel magic*** can shut down an item like a ***ring of regeneration*** for 1d4 rounds. Since the ring restores one hit point every turn (10 rounds), the DM will have to decide what effect this interruption will have on the ring-bearing creature. The simplest solution is to delay the regenerated hit point until the ring actually has operated a full, uninterrupted 10 rounds.`

If the color pool leads to one traveler's home plane, how does each character perceive it? A pool leading to a home plane would have the traveler's silver cord coming out of it, but what if there is no cord present?

            answer: [
                `Judging from the material on pages 62 and 63 of the ***MP***, each astral color pool has a distinct color depending on where it leads. However, when a pool leads to a character's home Prime Material plane, it always looks silvery no matter what its "normal" color is. When two characters from different Prime Material planes view a pool leading to a third Prime Material plane, they both see the same color.

            question: `Most psionic powers have a preparation time of zero. When running a psionicist in a campaign that uses segments, wizards and priests use casting times that take segments, rounds, or turns. This means a psionicist can call upon multiple powers in a single round and destroy several PCs or monsters before anyone else can even blink. What limits are there on psionics in campaigns that use segments?`,
            answer: [
                `Even in the original AD&D game, the basic unit of time is the one-minute melee round, not the six-second segment. During one round, a character can take one basic action. Spell-casting times and weapon speed factors affect initiative—they do not allow for multiple actions. That is, a wizard cannot cast 10 one-segment spells, and a fighter cannot attack 10 times with a weapon that has a speed factor of one. Multiple actions or attacks are possible under a variety of different circumstances, but never just by virtue of the segment system.`,
                `If you are playing a variant game that uses segments instead of rounds, you're on your own. The easiest fix would be to assign all psionic powers a "casting time" of at least one segment and use whatever rules you've cooked up to govern spell-casting to govern psionic power use as well. Note that the AD&D 2nd Edition game dispenses with the concept of segments altogether. Even when using the most complex optional initiative rules, things like casting times equate to a simple initiative modifier, which was the real intent behind the original game's segment system in the first place.`

Although the rules are not completely clear on the point, the text on page 14 that details maintaining powers leads me to believe that any power that is maintained turn by turn or hour by hour requires PSP expenditure by the turn or hour rather than by the round. In these cases, the initial PSP expenditure keeps the power going for the first turn or hour. However, the DM™ is free to assume that the initial cost can sustain the power for only the first round, and can require that maintenance costs be paid starting the next round. The former interpretation requires fewer PSPs than the latter, but since maintenance costs by the turn or hour are fairly low, it doesn't make much difference which way you decide to do things as long you treat all powers the same way.`,

On the other hand, the character can monitor an area just by describing it in general terms.

When faced with a very large fire, say a multifloor building aflame, the psionicist can control only the flames erupting from a 10-square foot area. Note that 10 square feet is not a very big area—it's 5' by 2' or 21⁄2' by 4', or some combination of dimensions that can be multiplied together to equal 10'. Compare this with a standard 10'x10' square on a dungeon map, which is 100 square feet.

                `An Inertial Barrier protects the user against disintegration from any source. The rules don't explain why, but here's my best guess: Disintegration destroys matter by setting up a vibration that causes objects and creatures to break into microscopic pieces and fly apart; an Inertial Barrier dampens the vibration and disrupts the effect.`,
                `The "missiles" created by a ***magic missile*** spells are purely magical and are not affected by Inertial Barriers. While an Inertial Barrier does not confer fire resistance, it can foil most fire-based attacks by keeping flames from reaching the user. That is, the user is protected against ***fireball*** spells, but still can get burned if he walks into a burning building or pool of molten lava. As explained in the devotion's description (see page 46), Inertial Barriers can be effective against *some* breath weapons, but not all. Breath weapons that are composed of pure heat, light, cold, electricity, or other forms of energy are not affected. Gas, acid, or flame breath weapons and any breath weapon that involves hurling or projecting some kind of matter are affected. When dealing with very powerful breath weapons, such as dragon breath weapons, I suggest that you allow the Inertial Barrier user to roll only the basic dice, not dice plus bonuses. For example, if an adult red dragon breathes through an Inertial Barrier, the defender rolls 12d10 vs. the dragon's 12d10+6. Assume that the plus represents the intrinsic power (heat, acidic potency, etc.) of what part of the breath does penetrate the Inertial Barrier.`

            answer: [
                `Since Body Equilibrium can be activated while the psionicist is falling (see the devotion's description on pages 55-56), I don't see any reason not to allow its use while sinking. The DM might choose to impose a power-score penalty, since it might be difficult to focus one's inner energies with a nose and mouth full of quicksand; I suggest an additional -1 to -4. In this case, the character will simply bob to the surface of the water or quicksand, where he probably can swim or slither to safety. Actually regaining one's feet and walking on the surface after being submerged and popping up like a cork would require considerable luck and dexterity.`,
                `A falling character using Body Equilibrium certainly could use Control Wind to influence where he lands. However, it would be quite difficult to slow a fall or to lift a grounded character using Control Wind, as the character must have an updraft to lift him. This would be impossible in still air. If the character found a strong thermal—on a sunlit hillside, for example—he might be able to increase and control the naturally occurring updraft enough to lift him, then glide to a landing some distance away. Note that such a feat would require ideal conditions; the character probably would have to be outside during a sunny day and on terrain that can create rising currents of warm air—open fields, rocky areas, and the like. Bodies of water don't generate thermals at all, and forests create very weak ones. This feat might also be possible indoors in chimneys, ventilation shafts, and other places where there is a lot of rising air.`

            question: `Can a ***wish*** be used to enhance a character's psionic abilities or to acquire psionic abilities? Or does the fact that a ***wish*** is magical and psionics is not prevent this?`,
            answer: [
                `Although the DM™ has final say on any ***wish***, there is no game reason that a character cannot use one to gain or augment psionic abilities. A ***wish*** *changes* "reality" and can accomplish all manner of things that lesser magics cannot.`,
                `All this however, begs a whole raft of other questions, such as how much psionics can be gained, and what kind.`,
                `The "best" way to use a ***wish*** to increase a character's psionic powers is to improve the character's ability scores (***DMG***, page 11), which in turn can improve some or all the character's power scores. Increasing the character's wisdom score also will increase the character's inherent potential (***CPH***, page 13). Generous referees will make such an increase retroactive. A ***wish*** also might allow a character to increase his total PSPs, from two to 10 points. A ***wish*** certainly could allow a character to "forget" one discipline, science, devotion, or defense mode and replace it with a power more to the character's liking. If ***wishes*** are very rare in your campaign, it also might allow a character to pick up an extra devotion either inside or outside the primary discipline, but I don't recommend that you allow characters to acquire extra sciences or disciplines this way. Likewise, it's probably okay to let characters ***wish*** for a wild talent, though stern referees will make such characters roll to test for wild talents when making the ***wish***. DMs who do this should feel free to chuckle evilly if the percentile roll is low enough to have revealed a wild talent without ***wishing*** and should feel free to apply the normal consequences if the roll is 97 or higher. I do not recommend that you allow characters with wild talents to ***wish*** for additional powers, but it should be okay to let them ***wish*** for more PSPs.`,
                `Of course, characters can attempt to exceed these limits, but when they do so the DM should either declare that the ***wish*** does not work, or should impose some sort of penalty on the character. "Okay, Hurd the Magnificent, you can have the Mass Domination science. Of course, you are now a 5th-level human psionicist, not a l0th-level elven wizard!"`,
                `As always, game-logic and game balance reasons exist for these limitations. From the standpoint of game logic, the mortal brain can harbor only so many psychic powers before it turns to mush. High-level psionicists can command a wide variety of powers only by virtue of long experience and training. In terms of game balance, ***wishes*** should be introduced into a campaign only to let the players make minor adjustments to their characters' fates. If the DM allows characters to use ***wishes*** to get cheap power, the challenge and fun of adventuring quickly wear off.`

Can the user turn into something fanciful such as an animated chair?`,
            answer: [
                `I suggest you treat Metamorphosis as a slightly altered version of the ***polymorph self*** spell (see ***PHB***, page 161); unlike a *polymorphing* spellcaster, the Metamorphosis user is limited to forms that have the same mass as his own body, and he must make a system shock roll when he changes form. However, the Metamorphosis user is not limited to the forms of creatures, and can maintain an assumed form so long as he has PSPs to maintain the power. The Metamorphosis user gets the assumed form's movement rate and armor class, along with its physical attacks. He does not get special abilities such as gaze weapons, breath weapons, weapon immunities, and so on. On the other hand, the character does gain certain vulnerabilities and immunities that are intrinsic to the assumed form. Common sense must rule here. For example, while a character Metamorphosed into a werewolf cannot shift shapes (and thus avoid further system shock rolls) and is not immune to normal weapons, a character Metamorphosed into a brick is immune to normal fire simply because bricks don't burn.`,
                `The power's description goes out of its way to say that the user can change into *anything*, so I'd be inclined to let PCs go wild when picking forms into which they can Metamorphose. Nevertheless, some limitations are in order, or PCs will abuse the power. I suggest that you assume that simple forms, such as bricks, have no senses except a faint sense of touch and pain. A character Metamorphosed into a brick cannot see, taste, hear, or smell. He can feel vibrations, however—even faint ones from a man-sized creature walking nearby—and he knows when somebody tries to break him. The DM could allow the character to turn into a brick with eyes, ears, and nose so the character could get more sensory input, but enemies will more easily spot the character. That character also will have some vulnerabilities a normal brick might not, such as susceptibility to ***stinking cloud*** spells and harpy songs. Likewise, a character Metamorphosed into a walking chair would have visible joints and muscles.`

If the Molecular Manipulation power check succeeds, the Body Weaponry user can feel the weak- ness in his arm. If the Body Weaponry user stops maintaining the power and allows the Body Weapon to change back into an arm, the weakness disappears because the arm is part of a creature—no longer an object and no longer subject to Molecular Manipulation. If a Body Weapon breaks—because of Molecular Manipulation or any other cause—the Body Weaponry user loses that chunk of body mass, as though the affected limb were severed. The broken piece immediately changes back to flesh (it is cut off from the flow of psychic power that kept it in weapon form), and the DM might rule that the Body Weaponry user must immediately drop the power, although there is no game-logic reason that he couldn't go on spending PSPs to maintain the broken stump. In any case, I don't recommend any spectacular or gory effects when the Body Weaponry user does drop the power—he should just have a healed-over stump.

You hold this contest in exactly the same way you hold any other psychic contest (see page 22), except that the victim uses his strength score and the attacker uses his power score.

Any item used in a Ballistic Attack inflicts 1d6 points of damage regardless of its "normal" damage rating; this is due to the tremendous velocity the devotion generates. I suppose a sheaf arrow used in a Ballistic Attack could do 1d8 points of damage if the DM so desires, but there's no guarantee the arrow will hit the target point first, so I suggest sticking with the standard 1d6. Using Telekinesis to wield a weapon is more like normal melee, and a hit inflicts the weapon's normal damage rating. Unless you allow items such as arrows and quarrels to be used as stabbing weapons in melee, I don't recommend you allow them to be used Telekinetically either. (I know some campaigns allow characters to make stabbing attacks with arrows when there's no other weapon available. A typical "house rule" governing such attacks sets the damage at 1d2 and the arrow usually breaks when it hits.)`,

            answer: [
                `Any ability bestowed onto the character by Animal Affinity is strictly temporary, and it completely disappears when the power is dropped or when the character chooses to assume a different animal attribute. If the character chooses to assume an animal's hit points, he in effect gets a whole new set of hit points that have nothing whatsoever to do with the hit points he has as a character.

If the character quits the cleric class to follow a class other than psionicist, or takes up the psionicist class before reaching 20th level as a cleric, he cannot become an elemental.

            question: `The statistics for character drag ons in ***Dragon Kings***, pages 37-39, don't match the summary information at the back of the book, nor does it match the description in the DARK SUN boxed set. Specifically, the summary information does not mention the psionic abilities listed on page 39—which give a 30th-level dragon 20 sciences and 35 devotions. Meanwhile, the boxed set gives the Dragon of Tyr a psionicist level of 20 (or 25, depending on which section you read), the ability to cast spells and use psionics simultaneously, and regeneration at 10 hp a round. Also, the hit-dice listings are widely different in all three places, and the burrowing movement rate of 6 listed in the boxed set is not mentioned in either section of ***Dragon Kings***. Finally, the footnote on the jumping movement rating in the supplement reads: "now has a 'jumping' movement rate of 5 (should be 6)". What does this mean? Is the jumping rate 5 or 6?`,
            answer: [
                `The mismatch within the ***Dragon Kings*** book is an editorial error. The text on dragons got changed in one section of the book, but not in the other—this kind of thing happens more often than anyone would like. Here are my unofficial suggestions for resolving the contradictions:`,
                `Use the psionic powers listed on page 39; this gives the Dragon of Tyr six disciplines, 20 sciences, 35 devotions, and five defense modes. Use the powers listed in the boxed set (see the "Monsters of Athas" section in the ***Wanderer's Journal***). Pick the additional 10 sciences and 11 devotions yourself, and assume that the powers listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal*** are the ones the Dragon uses the most. Note that the five defense modes listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal*** under the Telepathy discipline do not count toward the Dragon's total number of powers (see the ***Complete Psionics Handbook***, page 14).`,
                `Use the hit-dice listings from the supplement at the back of ***Dragon Kings***. This matches the table on page 37 at every level except 21, where the dragon should get +20d4, not + 10d4. Note that the Dragon of Tyr has nearly maximum hit points for a 30th-level dragon (250 out of a possible 254, assuming no Constitution bonuses).`,
                `The burrowing movement rate seems to have been dropped by mistake; I'd add it at 27th level.`,
                `The parenthetical note about increasing the jumping movement rate to 6 probably was an editor's note that accidentally found its way into the book. Since most movement rates in the AD&D® game are evenly divisible by three, somebody probably wanted the listing changed. I don't see any reason not to leave the jump rating at 5, which is how it is listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal***, but go ahead and increase it to 6 if it makes you happy.`,
                `The Dragon of Tyr's regeneration power and ability to use spells and psionics simultaneously are unique to it—it's a special beast, even as fully matured Athasian dragons go. The exact reasons this dragon is so special are unrevealed, but they might be uncovered in an upcoming DARK SUN game product or novel.`

This would seem essential for high-level avangions, who have no appendages.`,
            answer: [
                `The DM, of course, has the final say, but I suggest that any dragon that can fly be allowed to make snatches and plummets. Just apply the MC formulas to the ***Dragon Kings*** claw and bite ratings. Use the tail—attack ratings from ***Dragon Kings***. I'm inclined to think that Athasian dragons are not built in quite the same way as dragons are on other worlds, and I suggest that you disallow wing buffets. Likewise, I don't think Athasian dragons should kick.`,

It is unclear exactly how they accomplish this, especially in the case of high-level avangions. Note that while an advanced being can't launch spells any more quickly that any other spell-caster can, the DM should assume that they always have *some* way to complete any other requirements. Avangions, for example, can be assumed to flutter their wingtips to complete somatic components. Both dragons and avangions can be assumed to have some way to get at material components if that optional rule is in effect. Material components might be manipulated psionically, plucked from a pocket dimension, regurgitated from the gut, or whatever.

                `Although it is not common for a power to have a prerequisite from another discipline, there are several precedents in the Metapsionic discipline. Teleport Object was placed in the Psychokinetic discipline because it involves manipulating objects; Psychoportation involves personal movement by the power's user. If that doesn't satisfy you, change the Teleport Object prerequisite to Telekinesis.`,

The other products are designed for normal groups, but are set on particular worlds. This shouldn't be an impediment to DMs who have developed their own worlds, however. Any commercial scenario can be dovetailed into a homespun campaign. The premises behind some of these scenarios might not fit your particular campaign, but not every generic adventure will either. You shouldn't ignore a packaged adventure just because you're not interested in the world logo on the front cover.

Would a ***potion of speed*** or ***Wallac's potion of speed casting*** (1992 Collector card #272) reduce the time needed for a sha'ir's gen to find a spell? If not, what sort of item would?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***ring of wizardry*** does nothing for a sha'ir, as they cannot understand the ring's workings, nor use its power. A ***ring of wizardry*** doubles the number of spells a wizard can prepare each day, and sha'irs do not prepare spells daily. They send out their gens to look for spells as needed. Even if a sha'ir could understand how to use a ***ring of wizardry***, the sha'ir's gen still would only bring him one spell at a time and would not depart to search for a new one until the current spell was cast or had expired (see ***Arabian Adventures***, pages 98-99).`,
                `A ***pearl of power*** might work for a sha'ir, but I recommend against it. The item description implies that a pearl's function is based upon a wizard's daily spell preparation, insofar as the pearl only can recall a spell that was part of the wizards most recent preparation. On the other hand, one could argue that a ***pearl of power*** can recall any spell (of the appropriate level) that the user has memorized on a given day. The case can be made that a sha'ir has "memorized" a spell when his gen delivers it, In this case, the ***pearl*** can recall a spell only if the sha'ir has taken "delivery" of a spell of the pearl's level during the day that the pearl is used. For example, a sha'ir who owns a ***pearl of power*** keyed to second-level spells could not use it on a given day until his gen had successfully found and delivered a second. level spell.`,
                `***Wallac's potion of speed casting*** cannot shorten the time a gen requires to locate a spell. I suppose a wish could reduce the time to whatever the minimum would be for the type of spell being sought. For example, a sha'ir could wish that his gen would bring back a "native" sixth-level spell in seven rounds. Any attempt to break the minimum-time requirement using a *wish* should not only fail, but should immediately result in extra-planar attention for the sha'ir as explained under "The Perils of Priest Spells," on page 99—even if the gen is not seeking a priest spell. Stern DMs might roll for extra-planar attention whenever a wish is used to speed spell delivery.`,
                `Note that a sha'ir can benefit from Wallacks potion of speed casting. Once the sha'ir's gen has delivered a spell, the sha'ir must follow all the normal rules for spellcasting, including casting time, which can be reduced by ***Wallac's potion of speed casting***.`,
                `As "Sage Advice" has pointed out before, ***potions of speed***, ***haste*** spells, and similar other magics never shorten a spell's casting time.`

                `The AD&D 2nd edition game does not use segments, and the reference to them in the ***wall of ash*** psionic enchantment description (***Dragon Kings***, page 112) is an error. The spell's creator probably was thinking in terms of the original AD&D game, where a melee round was broken down into 10 segments.`,
                `Spending a full round in contact with a ***wall of ash*** causes 10d10 hp; getting away from the stuff in less than a full round reduces the damage. The easiest way to keep track of this damage is to use the standard initiative system from the current game. For example, Prythony the mul gladiator loses a wrestling match with an opposing half-giant and gets pinned in a ***wall of ash***. If the half-giant's attack came on an initiative number of "7," Prythony probably will spend the rest of the round in the ash, and will suffer 3d10 points of damage, one die on each remaining initiative number (8, 9, and 10). If Prythony rolls free during the next round after getting an adjusted initiative of "4," he'll suffer another 4d10 points of damage. Undoubtedly, things are going to be a lot more complex than this if ***wall of ash*** actually get used in play. However, the DM is going to have to be prepared to deal with such things as they arise—that's one consequence of running a campaign where characters have access to magic as powerful as ***wall of ash***.`,

            question: `I'm having some difficulty understanding what spells and powers the gods of Krynn grant their priests: Mishakals entry names eight spheres of spells that she grants plus the spells ***prayer*** and ***remove/bestow curse***. What do these two "plus" spells mean? How and when are the "powers per level" granted? One of the powers Kiri-Jolith grants is a +1 bonus to attacks on evil creatures; is this granted once a day or as many times as the cleric wishes?`,
            answer: [
                `The "plus" spells in each deity's list are spells the deity grants to his clerics even though they are not included among the spells covered by the deity's spheres. For example, Mishakal grants ***prayer*** from the Combat sphere and ***remove/bestow curse*** from the Protection sphere even though she does not grant other spells from these two spheres. "Plus" spells must be prayed for and memorized just like any other clerical spell.`,
                `The "powers per level" appear after each deity's name. Nonspell-like powers, such as bonuses to saving throws or attack rolls, are continuous and function whenever they are applicable. For example a priest of Kiri-Jolith always gets a +1 bonus to attacks vs. evil creatures.`,

These powers function just like the spells they are named after except that the cleric need not pray or meditate to get them—they are automatically granted each day. Each power's casting time is the same as the spell. If an effect's range, duration, etc. varies with the caster's level, use the priest's actual level to adjudicate the effect. For example, if a 10th-level priest of Majere uses the granted power ***silence 15' radius***, the effect lasts 20 rounds.

However, priests of Reorx can turn undead such as wights or shadows because these undead can drain life energy or ability scores. Likewise, priests of Reorx can turn non-undead creatures such as fetch, which have a draining attack. Priests of Reorx use table 61 from the ***PH*** (page 103) to resolve turning attempts, If a creature is not listed on the table, use the line from the table that shows the creature's hit dice.`,

I don't know exactly what you mean by "elemental powers." However, Elemental magic is not the sole province of the powers that rule the elemental planes. Just about every nature deity in the AD&D® 2nd Edition game grants its priests major access to Elemental spells, as even a cursory glance through ***Legends & Lore*** and other rule-books where deities are detailed will show. I assume the game logic behind this is the fact that nature—at least in the AD&D 2nd Edition game—is composed of the four basic elements: air, earth, fire, and water. In terms of game balance, this change allows druids, and other nature priests who do not have major access to the Divination sphere, to cast the ***commune with nature*** spell.

The DM is left to decide what constitutes the psionicist's "front" in this case, but the definite intent here is not to put this under the psionicist's control; exactly where the first portal should appear is up to the DM, but the spirit of the devotion's description would suggest that it should appear directly in front of the psionicist and about an arm's length away. ***CPH***-designer Steve Winter points out the psionicist has some control over the first portal's location just by deciding where he is facing when using the power.

                `Plate armor is more expensive than either plate mail or chain mail because it has to be custom-fitted for the wearer, while plate mail and chain mail can be worn "off the rack." Furthermore, plate armor is much more intricate than plate mail. A complex system of hinged plates covers the wearer's joints (in a suit of plate mail, the underlying chain mail does this job). Large or small, all the plates in a suit of plate armor are manufactured from thick, high-quality steel that is carefully hammered into the correct shape while the metal is cold. This process not only requires very good steel, it requires large pieces of steel that have a consistently high quality throughout. Chain mail, on the other had, can be manufactured from whatever bits and pieces of iron or steel the armorer has lying around.`,
                `Also, while making chain mail's many separate links is arduous, the armorer has the luxury of tossing out badly made links. An armorer who is hammering out a whole breastplate can't afford even small mistakes—if there is an error, an entire piece has to be thrown out or laboriously remade.`,
                `Finally, plate armor has to be periodically heated and cooled again during manufacture to restore the metal's strength and flexibility in a process called annealing. The armorer must carefully judge just how far he can push, pull, and bend the metal before it has to be annealed. Proper annealing makes a suit of plate armor very strong, but too much annealing yields metal that is much too weak to provide good protection. This additional opportunity for error makes plate armor production even more costly.`

I recommend you allow Athasian wizards to automatically know the type of magic on a scroll when they cast ***read magic*** spells to discover the scroll's contents. However, preserving is a more careful and thoughtful approach to magic than defiling, which is a sort of quick-and-dirty magic. If the DM chooses, it is reasonable to assume preservers can make adjustments while reading a scroll that prevent defiling. Likewise, it is reasonable to assume defilers can take shortcuts while reading a preserver scroll in order to release a defiling effect. In these cases, the adjustments are optional and should happen automatically if the character decides to make them. Note whenever an Athasian wizard writes a spell into his spell book, he writes according to his approach to magic, that is, preservers write preserving spells and defilers write defiling spells, even if the spell was discovered on a scroll written by the other type of wizard.`,

If the DM decides defiling works in other places, then any defiling spell creates an area of lifeless ash according to the amount of plant life in the area where the spell is cast (see the DARK SUN set's ***Rules Book***, page 60). How long it takes the locals to notice the devastation depends on where the defiler starts casting spells, who witnesses the spellcasting, how alert and caring the local deities are, and a whole host of other factors too numerous to mention here. Common sense has to be your guide. If the defiler casts a spell under the royal court wizard's nose, the locals will immediately notice something is up.

The prime factors, however, are body mass and the strength of the alcoholic beverage. A 150-pound human can expect to be drunk after drinking three ounces of hard liquor or 36 ounces of beer in one hour. An adult umber hulk probably weighs in at about 450 pounds, and probably could put away three times that much alcohol before becoming drunk.`,

THAC0s improved one point per column except that they improved by two on every second column. There also was the phenomenon of the "repeating 20" that I won't even try to explain here. The team eventually decided the old chart was illogical and had to go. The new chart is easier to remember and has the advantage of making things a little easier on PCs in campaigns that start out characters with zero experience points and base starting cash. Play balance in your game probably won't suffer much if you go back to the old chart, just remember to give out a little extra experience to PCs who defeat monsters that have the improved THAC0s.`

Since a 5' or 6' human can get the two-handed benefit by shifting his grip on sword's long hilt down toward the pommel, I suppose a nine-foot ogre could do the same thing with only one hand. In this case, the ogre has to use the two-handed speed factor. Note that a giant cannot get its extra damage dice unless it uses a weapon of proportionate size in the proper manner. That is, a hill giant might be able to use a bastard sword with one hand and inflict 2d4 points of damage (plus a strength bonus of +7); however, the giant has to use a giant-sized bastard sword in two hands if he wants to inflict 4d4 + 7 points of damage.`,

As you point out, they can go at least a week without food or water while regenerating. The DM has to decide how long it takes a troll to starve if completely deprived of food. I'd suggest anywhere from one to six months. In any case, troll regeneration does not need food or a source of matter, it simply replaces lost mass.

            answer: [
                `The rules don't have anything to say about Dexterity bonuses and cover or concealment. To preserve game balance, I suggest that you don't add Dexterity bonuses to modifiers for cover. This prevents characters with high Dexterity scores from becoming virtually immune to missile attacks when they take cover. From the game-logic standpoint, defensive Dexterity adjustments represent an active defense. The character moves in a way that helps defeat attacks. A character hunkered down behind cover is not free to make such movements; a character who is claiming more than 50% cover or concealment probably cannot even see attacks coming and, consequently, cannot respond to them.`,
                `One could make the same game-balance argument about combining magical defensive adjustments with cover, but the game logic doesn't hold up. Magical defensive bonuses function in a variety of ways, but they either make the protected character harder to hurt (by reinforcing armor, skin, and bone) or harder to hit (by deflecting blows, deceiving the attacker, or just serendipitously arranging things in the defender's favor). Taking cover does not interfere with any of these.`,
                `Cover and concealment are never cumulative. "Cover" indicates that the character has found a barrier that can stop incoming attacks. Solid objects such as walls and boulders provide cover. "Concealment" is not sturdy enough to stop attacks, but it does help spoil an attacker's aim by hiding part of the character (this is why concealment is referred to as "soft cover" in the AD&D 2nd Edition game). Bushes, tall grass, and even hanging laundry can provide concealment. Note that cover, by its very nature, offers some concealment and the defensive modifiers for cover already take this into account.`

In this interpretation, a ***spectral hand*** is strictly an instrument of combat and the magical channel between the caster and the ***hand*** can conduct only baneful magics.

            question: `In one of our game sessions, an NPC priest used a ***word of recall*** while a PC was on his back. As DM, I ruled that the priest and the PC both were transported back to the priest's sanctuary. Was I right?`,
            answer: [
                `You might have been right. Since the priest was not gagged, he could have completed the spell, which has a casting time of 1 and only a verbal component. (If the spell also had a somatic or material component or both, the PC on the priest's back would have prevented the casting. You just can't handle material components or complete somatic gestures while in the midst of a wrestling match.)`,
                `To reach a decision about this situation, you have to balance two conflicting premises: One, game balance absolutely requires that opponents have a chance to disrupt spells by interfering with the caster. Two, the ***word of recall*** spell is a powerful bit of magic that is especially designed to allow the priest to escape when the going gets rough.`,
                `Generally speaking, a character cannot complete a spell if she is hit by an attack or suffers damage during the casting process. However, just having something or somebody sitting on a spell-caster is not necessarily enough to break the character's concentration. If the PC were using the wrestling rules (***DMG***, page 59 or ***PH***, page 97) and had achieved a hold that could be maintained from round to round, I would not allow the spell to be used—you can't concentrate on magic when you're taking any kind of damage. If there was no hold, I'd go to the initiative dice, if the priest wasn't taking damage and beat the PC on initiative, I'd let the spell work. If the priest lost initiative, and the PC made any kind of successful attack, the spell would be ruined and be gone from the priest's memory. In any case, If the priest successfully cast the spell, I'd let the priest choose whether to take the PC along. If the priest did try to take the PC along, you'd need to check the priest's weight limit; if the PC and all the priest's equipment exceeded the weight limit, the spell would fail and the priest would be stuck. Note that, as I mentioned earlier, a gag would prevent the priest from using the spell no matter what was happening—no speech, no verbal component and no spell.`,

That is, the attack roll must be an unmodified 17 or better before there is a chance to sever a neck (the chance can drop depending on the target's size and construction).

I can understand why there might be an across-the-board difference, but why do some weapons do the same damage to both man-sized and large creatures while some weapons do less damage to large creatures and still others do more damage to large creatures?`,
            answer: [
                `As always, this boils down to questions of game logic and game balance. If you take a look at the tables on pages 68-69 of the ***PH***, you'll notice that most weapons that do less damage to large creatures are type B—crushing and bludgeoning weapons. The sheer body mass of a large creature tends to defeat these kinds of attacks. The remainder are very small, lightweight piercing weapons that have the same problem with large creatures.`,
                `Weapons that do more damage to large creatures tend to be fairly large slashing or piercing weapons that can get at a large creature's vitals.

                `The weapons that do the same damage to opponents of all sizes don't fit neatly into either category. A battle axe, for example, is a chopping weapon with a wedged-shaped blade that cuts well, but can't penetrate too deeply because it is relatively small.`,
                `When considering game balance, note most weapons that do extra damage to Large creatures are off-limits to wizards and most priests. Thieves and a few priests can get some of these weapons, but only warriors can get them all.

For example, a ***contingency*** that unleashes a ***dispel magic*** spell when a door is opened and in turn brings down a ***force field*** that releases a flood of molten metal is a trap.

            answer: [
                `The answers to these questions have appeared in print time and again, but not anytime recently and never in "Sage Advice," so here it goes:`,
                `Some kind of degree in English certainly won't hurt your chances of getting work with TSR, Inc., but your education isn't nearly important as demonstrating the ability to write about games. The best way for you to do this is to get something into print. Start by getting writer's guidelines for DRAGON® Magazine, DUNGEON® Adventures, and for the RPGA® Network (be sure to ask for both POLYHEDRON® Newszine guidelines and the tournament program). Note that the Newszine only accepts material from RPGA Network members, but anyone can submit tournaments. In any case, take what you've learned in your college English classes, write something, and submit it.`,
                `TSR, Inc., calls its "consulting writers" free-lancers, and it uses a fair number of them. However, just about every free-lancer TSR has ever used has had a full-time job and wrote for TSR to earn some extra cash—and for the thrill of it. There just isn't enough money in freelancing to make even a marginal living if that's all you do. So plan on finding a decent job when you graduate.`,
                `There are two official channels for inquiring about employment at TSR. One is the personnel department, which handles hiring; TSR's business address is printed on the back cover and title page of every TSR product. Adding the words "Attention Personnel Department" to the address on your letter will speed up any response. Frankly, writing to the personnel department probably will just get you a polite form letter, but you asked the question. The other channels are the various submissions editors. For magazines, write to the editorial address shown on the masthead—but get writing guidelines before you submit anything, and don't bother with resumes and long letters describing your life history. The Games Department of TSR does not consider submissions from unpublished authors; you have to get some experience first. If you don't have any luck with TSR's professional magazines, try writing for some of the industry's other companies (and their magazines), or see if you can locate a good fanzine or game-club newsletter. The latter small, amateur publications won't make you famous, but they're a good place to get your feet wet.`

                `Generally, yes. This also is the case in both editions of the AD&D game, too.`,
                `Unless the monster description states otherwise, undead have no special ability to detect creatures that are invisible, hidden, silent, or otherwise concealed.

                `I have encountered campaigns that assume undead creatures can somehow sense living creatures. The reasoning goes something like this: Undead have no functioning sense organs—their eyes, ears, etc.—have rotted away. Since they can detect neither light nor sound, their "senses" operate in some arcane manner that makes invisibility or silence irrelevant. This house rule can add a new dimension to undead, even to lowly creatures such as skeletons and zombies; however, the published rules assume that undead somehow really do see, hear, etc. If you decide to adopt an undead "sense life" rule, increase each undead monster's experience value to reflect this special ability to see invisible creatures. Also, you'll need to decide on a number of other parameters for the ability, such as its range and what, if anything, blocks or disrupts it.`

Could the iron be used for weapons, armor, and tools? If the wizard kept a piece of a ***wall of iron***, could she use it as the material components for more spells? Would this also be true for ***wall of stone*** or ***wall of ice***?`,
            answer: [
                `Iron is worth one gold piece (100 ceramic pieces) per pound in DARK SUN® campaigns (see ***Dune Trader***, page 72). A ***wall of iron*** contains a minimum of 12,403 lbs. of iron (about 25 cubic feet at 490 pounds per cubic foot). However, in DARK SUN campaigns, a ***wall of iron*** spell has a duration of one turn per caster level (see the DARK SUN rule book, page 93). A wizard might be able to sell a few chunks of iron as a scam, but the practice will catch up with her if she tries it too often.`,
                `While the material in a ***wall of iron*** functions as normal iron in most respects, there is no reason why a Dungeon Master has to assume it can be worked as regular metal can. For example, the DM might decide that iron from a ***wall of iron*** contains certain impurities that cause it to form useless lumps of slag if heated and worked, and that it simply flakes apart if worked cold. Note also that, regardless of its duration, metal from a ***wall of iron*** radiates magic and can be dispelled. Even if it could be used to manufacture items, those items can be destroyed by ***dispel magic*** effects.`,
                `Having material components for spells is an optional rule. I don't know any DM who uses this rule and also lets his players get around it by using magically created material components—this is a question of game balance. From the standpoint of game logic, the dweomer that maintains the ***wall of iron*** or other magically created material either interferes with the spellcasting process or unravels during the process. First, attempts to cast spells using a magically created object as a material component are disrupted. Second, the magically created material component ceases to be and it just isn't available to complete the spell. In either case. the attempted spell fails. Some exceptions exist. Generally, items brought into being by a ***wish*** work fine as material components, at least if the component is not rare or valuable; and a ***Zagyg's spell component case*** (from ***Unearthed Arcana***) always produces usable material components.`

The first thing the DM has to do is identify the most notable and powerful good-aligned NPCs in the game; such characters are certain to make overtures to an avangion when they learn that such a creature exists.

            answer: [
                `Longevity is not necessarily synonymous with hardiness. A parrot lives a lot longer than a horse, but horses have much better Constitution scores than parrots do. Still, play balance in your campaign probably won't suffer if you fiddle with demihuman racial modifiers a bit. If you want to give elves a Constitution bonus, just eliminate the Dexterity bonus and assign a penalty to some other ability score; elves in your campaign might have lower Wisdom scores since their long years tend to make them a bit frivolous and impulsive.`,

Can the caster pass through solid objects such as stone? Can he travel underwater? Can the caster move in three dimensions? For example, can he descend into the ocean? Does the water even exist as far as the spell-caster is concerned?`,
            answer: [
                `Since the spell's primary use is for rapid travel on the Prime Material plane (in fact, the caster never actually leaves the Prime Material plane), I suggest that you allow the user to see the portion of the Prime Material that immediately surrounds him. What the character sees is a monochromatic mass of shadows, just like what is visible at twilight (see table 62 from the revised ***PH***, page 117). Since the caster is traveling at 126 miles an hour (seven leagues a turn), he probably isn't going to seem too many details while moving—objects would fly by in one gray blur.`,
                `The spell does not grant the power of flight, but it does negate most terrain penalties. The caster can dash along the bottom of the ocean, through swamps, and over mountains.

The caster can pass through cracks as though using a ***wraithform*** spell, but cannot pass through solid objects. Note that the caster must be is a mass of deep shadows to begin the spell, and I suggest that the caster always must end in shadows as well.`,

(Just how did Ailuj save that village from a great wyrm when she was only 16? Or why is that gold dragon doing just about everything that lich tells him to and how do we stop it?). There is no save vs. this spell, so the reference to a save in the spell description (issue #182, page 12) probably is supposed to refer to the dragon's magic resistance, if it is old enough to have any.`,

            answer: [
                `Generally speaking, when the irresistible force (***sword of wounding*** prevents magical healing short of a ***wish***) meets the immovable object (***periapt of wound closure*** prevents all open, bleeding wounds) you should rule in favor of the defensive power.`,
                `In the case of a ***sword of wounding***, the periapt prevents the wearer from taking the extra points of bleeding damage each round—the wound closes. In addition, the periapt wearer heals naturally at double the normal rate even if struck by a ***sword of wounding***. The DM is free to rule that the periapt also allows magical healing of damage from a ***sword of wounding***. I know many DMs who consider a ***periapt of wound closure*** to be equal to or better than a ***wish*** when it comes to healing wounds. If you follow the item's description to the letter, however, you'll come to a different conclusion. While the periapt allows the healing of wounds that wouldn't do so otherwise, ***sword of wounding*** damage heals naturally at the normal rate. The periapt's "heal anything" power always applies to such things as damage inflicted by mummies, which normally do not heal unless a ***cure disease*** spell is applied first. In this case, the periapt wearer recovers hit points at the normal rate. He still is infected with mummy rot, however, and will die eventually if the disease is not cured. The item's description makes no specific mention of allowing magical healing that otherwise would not be possible, only normal healing that wouldn't otherwise be possible.`,
                `A ***periapt of wound closure*** does not prevent damage nor does it provide instantaneous healing. So I can't think of any reason why the wearer couldn't have her appendages severed by a ***sword of sharpness*** or otherwise forcibly removed—though the periapt would prevent any additional damage from bleeding that the DM might otherwise assign for the loss of an appendage.`

If a familiar dies of old age does the wizard still have to make a system shock check and lose one point of Constitution? What happens to a familiar if its wizard dies? Can a familiar's hit points ever be increased?`,
            answer: [
                `The spell description (see ***PH***, page 134) says the spell grants the familiar an exceptionally long life. It is up to the DM to define this, but I suggest that the familiar should have a basic longevity equal to the standard lifespan for the spell-caster's race (see ***PH***, table 11, page 24). For example, a human caster's familiar would live 90 +2d20 years. To calculate the familiar's starting age, use the figures on table 11, but treat any maximum dice results as minimums. For example, a human's familiar would have a starting age of 16-18 years—base 15 + 1d4 years, treating a rolled "4" as a "1". Given this approach, a familiar should not be in danger of dying of old age before the caster does unless it is exposed to magical aging or unless the caster receives a magical boost to his own lifespan. In either of these cases, the caster is obliged to care for his familiar, and the DM should inflict the full penalty if the caster allows the familiar to die. Note that ***wishes***, ***potions of longevity***, and other magics that can extend a character's lifespan also work on familiars.`,
                `The spell description says a familiar loses one hit point a day if separated from the caster. One could argue that death certainly is a separation. If the caster is raised or resurrected before the familiar dies, the familiar is saved. On the other hand, the DM might rule that the familiar can avoid hit-point loss simply by remain- ing within one mile of the caster's body. In any case, the bond between the caster and the familiar should be dissolved at some point if the caster dies and is not raised or resurrected. The dissolution of the bond ends the familiar's dependence on the caster and frees the familiar from the caster's control. The DM is free to decide how long it takes for the bond to dissolve; it might dissolve instantly on the caster's death, which would force the wizard to summon a new familiar any time he dies and is brought back, and it probably should be no longer that a number of days equal to the familiar's hit points.`,
                `The spell description says a familiar has 2-4 hit points plus one hit point per caster level. I suggest you take this literally and give the familiar an extra hit point when- ever the caster gains a new level.`

            question: `What happens when you put a ***bag of holding*** and a ***portable hole*** together? A friend told me you get something like a nuclear explosion. Also, after reading DRAGON issue #192, I began to wonder what would happen if you put a ***bag of holding*** or ***portable hole*** into a ***bag of devouring***?`,
            answer: [
                `See the ***portable hole*** description in the ***DMG***, page 177 for the consequences of putting one of these items inside another. There are no explosions, but characters might wish there was one instead.`,
                `It is up to the DM to decide what happens when an extra-dimensional space is placed inside a ***bag of devouring***. I can think of two possible outcomes: One, the ***bag of devouring*** works normally—it swallows the bag or hole just as it swallows any other bit of animal or vegetable matter. Since a ***portable hole*** is made of some pretty peculiar stuff, it's possible that the monster won't decide the hole is food and won't swallow the hole immediately (see ***DMG***, page 159. This might make it possible to remove the ***portable hole*** before it's too late. (In campaigns where this happens, foolhardy PCs just might decide this is a good way to test magical bags to see if they are bags of devouring; however, this is not a very smart thing to do when you consider the possible danger.) Two, the ***bag of devouring*** acts like any other extradimensional space. In the case of a the ***portable hole***, a gate opens to another plane and everything within a 10' radius is sucked in. Sadistic DMs will decide that the other plane is the monster's gullet, but this doesn't have to be the case. Technically, both items should be destroyed when the gate opens, severing the connection between the bag and the monster. The rules are unclear about what happens when you try to place one ***bag of holding*** inside another, so I recommend that the ***bag of devouring*** either quietly swallow the ***bag of holding*** or that the ***bag of devouring*** simply ruptures and dumps its contents into nilspace just as a ***bag of holding*** does if overloaded (see the ***DMG***, page 160).`,

                `A lawful alignment generally does imply a desire for order, but not necessarily a liking for bureaucracy. War by its very nature is disruptive and chaotic, so its natural antithesis is law. Furthermore, finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, and identifying conflicts that cannot be solved peacefully, requires patience, dedication, and self discipline. Consider the great degree of self sacrifice that most United Nations peacekeeping efforts require—peacekeepers have to set a non-violent example and tend to be in great danger all the time. These are not virtues associated with chaos. Note that lawful-good creatures seek what is best for the greatest possible number of thinking, deserving beings. This generally includes some measure of freedom and diversity—elves are just as deserving of the fruits of peace as are dwarves, halflings, humans, and other races who have enough self control not to act in a predatory fashion all the time. Only neutral or evil lawful beings seek to establish rigid codes that much be slavishly followed.`,

All such attempts should be played out, with the DM making sure that the NPC in question is suitably wary. Note that this kind of testing can be both unreliable and dangerous. For example, if a party finds a magical sword in one of Ravenloft's domains, they have no easy way to check its alignment, even if they handle it themselves. If a sword has a lawful-neutral alignment, any lawful character can handle it safely (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 187), and the PCs might just arm a lawful-evil adversary. Likewise, a sword with a chaotic-good alignment is dangerous to any character who is not chaotic good. Handing such a weapon to a potentially friendly lawful-good NPC is certain to sour relations.`

                `Since the kit description describes the dodge ability as a sudden, agile leap to safety, I'm inclined to suggest that you treat a dodge as an action. If the jongleur loses initiative, she can either use her dodge ability or forego it, weather the attack, and take another action. If the jongleur wins initiative and takes an action, she cannot dodge until the next round. Alternatively, you might allow a jongleur who has won initiative and taken an action to dodge during the same round if she beats the opponent's die roll—each character rolls 1d6, if the jongleur rolls higher, she can attempt to dodge. If the roll is tied or the jongleur rolls lower than her opponent, she has to take her lumps like any other character.`,

            answer: [
                `You resolve this contest the same way you'd resolve any other psychic contest. Many readers seem to be confused by the fact that the psychic contest rules (see ***The Complete Psionics Handbook***, pages 22-24) use attack and defense modes as an example. All psychic combat takes the form of a psychic contest, but you use the psychic contest mechanics whenever two or more psychic powers are in conflict—the presence or lack of attack or defense modes notwithstanding. As one example, if two wild-talent psionicists are trying to Telekinese an object, use the psychic contest rules. In your example, the character using Synaptic Static uses his Synaptic Static power score for the contest and the other psionicist uses her Elongation power score. If the Synaptic Static user wins the contest, the Elongation power fails. If the Synaptic Static user initiated the power first, he is the defender in the contest and he wins ties. If the Synaptic Static user initiates the power in order to disrupt the Elongation power, he is the attacker.`,

            question: `There seem to be some very similar proficiencies in the ***Complete Spacefarer's Handbook*** and the ***War Captain's Companion***. In particular, ***Spacefarer's*** features Wildspace Navigation, Phlogiston Navigation, Slow Respiration, Signaling, and Zero-Gravity Combat. On the other hand, ***War Captain's*** offers Celestial Navigation, Slow Breathing, Semaphore, and Freefall. Generally, these proficiencies have similar purposes, but different game mechanics.`,
            answer: [
                `These two works actually were developed in parallel, one by the TSR, Inc. staff and the other by freelancers, so the overlap isn't surprising. While you are correct that the proficiencies in question are very similar, their game effects can be quite different.`,
                `The three Navigation proficiencies seem to be similar on the surface, but work differently. The ***Spacefarer's*** skills allow a navigator to move more efficiently between points in space. (This implies that the navigator knows where he is, but this isn't necessarily the case. The only thing the navigator really knows is what to do in order to get where he's going in the shortest possible time, which could be a seat-of-the-pants undertaking.) The ***War Captain's*** skill allows a navigator to know exactly where his ship is in relation to his destination (and to the rest of the sphere if he also has the Astronomy proficiency). Celestial Navigation also allows the character to direct ramming attacks. All three proficiencies allow navigators to avoid hazards. If you have both books, you might consider requiring a character to know Celestial Navigation before learning Wildspace or Phlogiston Navigation (though dropping Celestial Navigation altogether would makes things a lot simpler for PCs).`,
                `Slow Respiration is a mental skill (based on the character's unmodified Wisdom score) that is fairly easy to use; it also incapacitates the character, allowing no other actions. Slow Breathing is a difficult physical act (based on Constitution score -5), which has the same effect as Slow Respiration but allows the characters to at least move around. Further, a character using Slow Breathing can converse, eat, and even fight if she makes an additional proficiency check. Slow Respiration is best for most characters because it doesn't carry a huge ability-score penalty. However, a character with a very high Constitution score might be better off with Slow Breathing. The logic behind both proficiencies seems sound to me, and your campaign won't suffer if you make both proficiencies available.`,
                `Semaphore and Signaling do virtually the same thing, so use your judgment and pick one for your game. Signaling is easier to use (Intelligence +2 instead of unmodified Intelligence for Semaphore), but Semaphore allows the user to send and receive messages more quickly if he spends extra slots on the skill. Whatever you pick, it would be best to drop the other proficiency from your game.`,
                `Freefall allows a character to temporarily ignore sudden shifts in gravity. This is quite different from Zero-Gravity Combat, which allows a character to fight normally in the total absence of gravity—and even move around a bit. Both these proficiencies should be useful to spacefarers. Note these skills don't overlap: Freefall does not negate the combat penalties for fighting in the absence of gravity (see ***Concordance of Arcane Space***, page 14). Likewise, Zero-Gravity Combat does not prevent a character from being tossed about, perhaps catastrophically, when her ship's gravity plane shifts.`

This is an inherent limitation to the double-arrow trick, since it takes extra time to properly arrange the arrows on the bowstring. Note that only two arrows can be placed in the bow at once. Also, no archer can make two double-arrow shots in the same round without a ***haste*** spell or similar magic. I suppose the elf could declare a quick-draw in addition to a double-arrow, but since the elf still can use the bow only twice, he would incur the quick-draw "to hit" penalties for nothing. Otherwise, an elf can combine the other types of trick shots; just add up the modifiers. Of course, the elf needs to make special preparations to combine some kinds of shots. For example, an elf using a quick-draw from a hanging-tree position wouldn't have enough arrows on hand to make her multiple shots without some sort of special equipment to keep the arrows in her quiver as she hangs upside down.`,

            question: `What happens to a dual-classed character if the level of his original class is suddenly boosted so that it matches or exceeds the level in his current class? For example, a 6th-level fighter/7th-level mage would normally be free to use his warrior and wizard abilities without penalty because his mage level exceeds his fighter level. If the character reads a ***manual of puissant skill at arms*** and becomes a 7th-level fighter, what happens? Does the character have to go back to choosing which class he will use for each adventure until he reaches 8th level as a mage?`,
            answer: [
                `Judging from the text on page 45 of the ***PH***, it's pretty clear to me that the character has to go back to choosing which class to use again, just as he would if he were to lose a level to an energy drain and became a 6th-level mage.`,
                `It would be entirely reasonable for the DM to rule that the character cannot benefit from the manual at all. The text on page 45 says that a dual-classed character never can gain experience in a class once it has been abandoned in favor of another class. The only exception to this is that a character can replace levels that are lost somehow.`,
                `Considering the rarity and power of magical books, I don't think the campaign would suffer if the manual worked; the character is not actually devoting any time or energy to studying the old class—he's just the recipient of a big power dump. The DM, however, would not be violating the spirit of the rules by not allowing it; there's no compelling reason to automatically assume the character can retain or utilize what the book grants.`

Can the mirror be used to capture short "takes" as long as the total recording time doesn't exceed the ***mirror's*** capacity of 24 hours? Can the ***mirror*** be used to capture sunlight to provide illumination and confound undead? Can the ***mirror*** be used to copy maps or scrolls?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***mirror of retention*** (from the ***Tome of Magic***, page 140) must be hung in a room no larger than 50' square and commanded before it will function. If the ***mirror*** is removed from the wall, it stops recording. It can be played back anywhere, however. I suppose a party could carry a ***mirror of retention*** from place to place in a dungeon or large building, and use it to take snapshots, but remember that it doesn't work unless it is hung in a room that does not exceed the size limit. The party could hang it on a wall and use it to record an encounter in a chamber, but if the PCs are carrying the ***mirror*** during an encounter it records nothing.`,
                `A ***mirror of retention*** can record sunlight streaming into a room, but the image played back on the ***mirror*** is just that, an image. The recorded sunlight has no affect on undead and the light the mirror sheds during playback is very faint, no brighter than a television screen in a dark room. The playback could be used as a weak light source in a pinch, but a character couldn't see very much with it.`,
                `If the ***mirror*** is properly hung and operated, it could record a map or other piece of mundane writing—provided the room where the ***mirror*** is hung has sufficient light for reading at the time of recording. The ***mirror*** also could record a superficial image of a magical scroll, but such images are useless; they cannot be used to cast any spells inscribed on the scroll or to add the spells to a spell book; it takes the original scroll—in its entirety—to produce its magical effects. Note that if the image in the ***mirror*** were usable, then the writing on the scroll would fade as soon as it was recorded. Subsequently, if the image is read or copied from the ***mirror*** it fades away, too. A scroll can be used only once, and player characters cannot get around this limitation easily, and certainly not through a ***mirror of retention***.`

            answer: [
                `Nothing special happens when the spell is cast in close quarters. A ***mirror image*** spell not only creates multiple images, but considerable distortion as well. In this case, the distortion is probably just a little stronger than normal. Provided the caster is free to move, attacks against the caster still have a chance to be misdirected. On the other hand, if the caster has his head on a chopping block, a ***mirror image*** spell isn't going to make the headsman miss.

            answer: [
                `This is up to the DM, but I strongly recommend that only the most powerful item functions. In other words, if the character in your example had an ***amulet of magic resistance***, 20% along with the ***robe of the archmagi***, which grants 5% magic resistance, the character still would have only a 20% magic resistance (from the ring). I recommend that you apply this rule even for naturally magic resistant creatures such as drow or tanar'ri. Magic resistance in the AD&D 2nd Edition game is a powerful ability, and once the DM lets it get out of hand, your game balance probably will go right out the window.`,
                `If you're playing the AD&D 1st Edition game, where magic resistance is adjusted according to the level of the caster and a magic-resistant creature can't necessarily walk around causing magical effects to collapse, you can afford to be a little more lenient. Even then, be careful. High-level games give you a little more breathing room; at low level, magic resistance in the original game is even more formidable that it is in the current game. If you decide to make magic resistance cumulative in your original AD&D campaign, you still should not allow magic resistance to accumulate if it comes from similar sources. A drow wearing a ***robe of the archmagi*** could add the 5% to her natural magic resistance, and wizard could add the values of a ***robe of the archmagi*** and an ***amulet of magic resistance***. No character, however should be able to wear two ***amulets of magic resistance*** and add their effects together, only the most powerful amulet should function.`

The spell-caster decides where the effect will originate (within the limits of the spell) and the DM decides who or what is within the area of effect. Other area effects, such as dragon breath, work exactly the same way. In the case of dragon breath, the dragon "aims" the breath weapon as it wishes and anything caught in it must save vs. the effect. There are several other forms of attack that don't require attack rolls, such as gaze weapons and mental attacks. Note that while such attacks always "hit" they don't always work; most of these attacks allow a saving throw that negates or reduces the effect.`,

            answer: [
                `According to ***The Complete Priests Handbook***, three priests (or clerics) of the same faith of at least 2nd level must get together in a temple dedicated to their deity and pray for a full hour. At the end of the hour, they must cast ***create water***, ***protection from evil***, and ***purify food and drink***. This process creates a half gallon of holy water (16 four-ounce vials). Any extra water from the ***create water*** spell must be channeled off before the ritual is complete, or the DM can assume that the extra water simply disappears during the ritual. For every two priests added to the group, an additional half gallon of holy water can be created, up to a maximum of four gallons of holy water at one time. I strongly suggest that you require holy water to be held in specially ***blessed*** vials (cost 2-5 gp each). You might also require an expensive font and basin (value 100-10,000 gp, depending on capacity) to hold the holy water while it's being created and dispensed into vials. If the DM wants more control over who creates holy water and when, it wouldn't be unreasonable to add extra spells to the ritual. I'd suggest ***chant***, (to be maintained the whole time) ***bless***, ***prayer*** and possibly ***combine***. The required vials can be ***blessed*** in a similar ritual, which is required to make the ***blessing*** permanent.`,

                `This is entirely up to the DM. I suggest that regeneration not reduce Constitution or require a resurrection-survival roll. A regenerating creature never truly dies, though it can be incapacitated by a grievous injury. Once the character drops to zero or fewer hit points, however, the character is unconscious or incapacitated even if the "Hovering on Deaths Door" rule is in use. Note that a character hovering on deaths door does not actually die until he reaches -10 hit points; if the DM has decided that regenerating back from death would reduce the character's Constitution score, the point is not lost unless death actually occurs.`,

In this case, unless the tower wall as an opening at least 20' tall to admit the ***wall of fire***, the effect stops when it encounters the tower. I don't think it's reasonable to have the whole spell collapse, but the DM might force to spell-caster to reduce the radius until the ***wall of fire*** fits in the space available, or to use the sheet version of the spell arranged in a ring; this version has a total area that is less than one tenth of the ring's area.

This is why a battlefield where ***defiling regeneration*** has been used is littered with ashen footprints instead of great circles of ash. An opponent engaged in combat with a protected creature does not suffer any pain or initiative penalties as she would if caught in the area of destruction created when a defiler casts a normal spell. I suppose an opponent could be hurt if a creature protected by this spell was *regenerating* while in flesh-to-flesh contact (as might be the case during wrestling or overbearing combat), but the only effect would be non-damaging pain and the accompanying initiative penalty.`,

            answer: [
                `Generally speaking, you should go with the most recently published material. Other considerations sometimes take precedence, however. In the case of ***dispel illusion***, for example, you're dealing with a spell that has been written out of the current game. Illusionists in the original game got this spell as a third-level spell, and wu jen (who are generalists) got it as a fourth-level spell.

                `The spell description doesn't give any limit to the number of ***stoneskin*** spells a creature can enjoy at once. This, however, can lead to tremendous abuse. (One hundred ***stoneskins*** each? Give me a break!) I strongly suggest that you roll only once for the number of attacks a ***stoneskin*** spell negates and that this number applies no matter how many spells subsequently are cast on the recipient. For example, if a 20th-level wizard casts three ***stoneskin*** spells on a fighter, roll 1d4 + 10 for the number of attacks negated. If the roll is a "2" the fighter is protected from 12 and only 12 attacks. Once 12 attacks negate the spell the fighter can receive a fourth spell and can make a new roll. I also recommend that you give ***stoneskin*** a maximum duration of one day. This prevents a wizard with time on her hands from casting ***stoneskin*** on every soldier in an army.`,

                `Generally speaking, one of a ***stoneskin's*** protections is negated for each attack roll made against the character. A reasonable DM is going to call for one roll if a handful of pebbles is thrown at a target because all the pebbles are released at about the same time and all hit at about the same time, so this kind of attack should count against a ***stoneskin*** spell only once. Otherwise, a character could blow down a ***stoneskin*** by hurling handfuls of sand or dust. Likewise, an avalanche or cave-in negates one attack.

If two modes can be used at once, does it requires a "six-finger" contact to attack the defender's mind?`,
            answer: [
                `As my colleague Rich Baker has pointed out the way in which psionic defenses are structured and the round-by-round limits of power use makes using two defense modes at the same time impossible. A psionicist can initiate one power each round, plus one defense mode, and can maintain any number of powers provided that he has sufficient PSPs (see ***CPH***, page 22). However, of the five defense modes (Mind Blank, Thought Shield, Mental Barrier, Tower of Iron Will, and Intellect Fortress) only mind blank can be maintained. The other four defense modes must be reinitiated each round (that is what the "na" under maintenance cost means). Mind Blank automatically switches off when another defense mode is initiated (see the power's description on page 88, 2nd and 5th paragraphs). Since a character can initiate only one defense each round, and no defense lasts more than a single round (except for Mind Blank with its automatic switch off) it's pretty difficult for a character to have two defense modes operating at once. If through some unusual twist of fate a character does have two defense modes operating at once, she gets the benefit of only the best one, and it still takes only three tangents to force a contact. ***Haste*** spells do not allow characters to violate the one-power-one-defense limit. Also, the Split Personality science creates two separate personalities within the user's body. Each personality can operate a defense mode each round, but the character still is limited to one defense per personality.`,

According to the ***PH***, the circle of power has a 30' diameter, but the ***DMG*** says the radius is five feet. The ***PH*** says the ***dispel*** ability works on hostile magic. Does this mean that friendly magic is unaffected? Is the ***dispel*** ability continuous while the sword is held? Can any magic pass through the radius?`,
            answer: [
                `Though there has yet to be any official rulings, the current thought at TSR, Inc., is as follows: The ***dispel magic*** and magic resistance powers have a five-foot radius. The magic resistance is continuous while the sword is unsheathed and held (by a paladin). ***Dispel magic*** is not continuous and must be invoked by the paladin holding the sword. Doing this counts as an action and the ***dispel*** affects all magic in the radius, hostile or not. Because the ***dispel*** is instantaneous, it usually cannot stop magic from passing though the radius—this power is most effective against in-place effects.`,
                `The magic-resistance power functions according to the rules for magic resistance in the ***PH*** and ***DMG***. Note that magic resistance comes into play only when magic can affect the protected creature. A spell that is just passing though is not affected. For example, a ***magic missile*** targeted at a creature 20' behind the paladin works normally. If the same spell is targeted at the paladin or at any other creature within five feet of the paladin, the magic resistance comes into play. Note that in some cases a spell can be blocked by default. For example, a blast from ***fireball*** affects anything within its area of effect. If a holy swords magic-resistance roll succeeds against the blast, then the blast is completely excluded from the five-foot magic-resistance radius. If the blast is rushing down a corridor at the paladin the magic resistance radius will completely block the blast if the corridor is small enough. This does not mean that a holy sword blocks all ***fireballs*** and similar effects. If, for example, a ***fireball's*** glowing missile is set to detonate outside the magic-resistance radius, the missile can explode normally, but if the magic-resistance roll succeeds, anything within the radius is protected from the blast.`

            answer: [
                `A ***combine*** spell gives a power boost to the central priest in the group using the spell. It does not grant the central priest powers or spells that would not normally be available to him. So, a druid who is the central priest in a ***combine*** spell cannot turn undead. The central priest in a ***combine*** spell can draw power from the supporting circle to enhance undead-turning or any spell that has level-based variables, such as range, damage, and duration. The spell description does not mention any special requirements for members of the circle except that they must be priests, so I'm inclined to suggest that the type of the priests in the circle does not matter. The central priest draws raw power from the circle and uses that power to enhance his own abilities. Note that while the spell description mentions only undead turning, the DM might allow any level-based granted power to be enhanced with a ***combine*** spell, provided that the power has details that vary with level. Remember that the central priest always must be the most powerful priest in the group and that ***combine*** does not grant powers that the central priest cannot normally use. A group of low-level druids, for example, cannot use ***combine*** to boost the central druid to seventh level so he can ***shape change***. Likewise, if a power is usable only a limited number of times each day, ***combine*** does not allow the central priest to exceed that limit.`,

Recently, the PCs in my game infiltrated the home of the local dictator and the party's thief made off with a ring that ultimately turned out to be worth 5,000 gp (after rolling for its value on the art objects table). The thief also took other treasures from the house. Do I have to give this character 10,000 XP?`,
            answer: [
                `A DM never *has* to give a PC any experience at all, but it's usually a good idea to do so if you want your players to come back for another game. Individual experience-point awards always are given at the DM's discretion. Some guidelines for determining when an individual award is appropriate are given on page 48, right below Table 34: Was there a reason for the character to take the action? Was there a significant risk to the character? If the answer to either question is yes, some sort of award is merited. Was the action detrimental or abusive to the other PCs? If the answer is yes, an award is not merited. If you decide to make the award, you also must decide how much experience to award; two points of experience for each gold piece worth of treasure is only a guideline. If you think it's too much, by all means reduce it. If the character in question is high level and 10,000 XP represents only a fraction of the experience requirement for the next level, you probably should award it all, especially if the character did her pilfering in a heroic manner that did not leave the rest of the PCs in the lurch. If the character is low level and 10,000 XP represents most or all the experience requirement for the next level you should give only a fraction of the 10,000 XP. You also should reduce the award of the thief who abandoned her companions in the face of danger; for example, if the thief sneaked off to rifle the bedroom while the other PCs were locked in a deadly combat with the dictator's pet owlbear, the award should be reduced or eliminated altogether. Note that if the dictator is one of the PCs' major foes, the theft might increase the story award for the group as a whole, especially if the loss interfered with some devious scheme the villain had planned.`,

            question: `Could you establish some guidelines for the chances of hitting objects? For example, what is the armor class of the broad side of a barn? Any fool ought to be able to hit it, but if you assign it an armor class of 10, a 1st-level mage has a substantial chance of missing, even from three feet away. What is the chance for hitting the bullseye of a moving target in a shooting gallery? What does it take to hit a candle's flame with a sword without disturbing the candle? How hard is it to cut straps on an opponent's armor?`,
            answer: [
                `Technically, AC 10 is the worst armor class in the game—things just don't get easier to hit than that. Note, however, that various modifiers can apply to attack rolls, even against objects. Sleeping or magically held targets, for example, are hit automatically in melee. Barns don't actually sleep, but they aren't very lively either, so melee attacks generally hit them automatically. On the other hand, if a character was trying to chop a hole through a barn wall with a dagger, I'd require a successful attack roll vs. AC 10, because all the character's blows have to land in about the same place or the character never makes a hole.`,
                `Missile attacks are a different story. I suggest giving your barn AC 10, with a +4 bonus to the attack roll for a stunned defender. (Barns are rather passive, after all.) In this situation, your 1st-level mage sure could miss an arrow shot from three feet away. I don't have a problem with this; I've seen inexperienced archers attempting to shoot and some of them really could miss the broad side of a barn. Note that in this case, a "miss" probably indicates that the character completely flubbed the shot.`,
                `Shooting gallery targets can have just about any armor class you care to assign to them. Assuming that the gallery patrons are normal humans, I'd suggest AC 8 for stationary targets that are about the size of a man's chest, AC 4 for moving targets the same size, AC 0 for smaller moving targets and AC -2 for the target that can win the shooter the big prize. Note that such targets can be made much harder to hit by increasing their speed, and by nefarious tricks such as slipping badly fletched or crooked arrows to the shooter; if adventurers show up at a shooting gallery, the owner most likely will shut the place down or do something to stack the odds in her favor.`,

In short, the most likely theory is that when conditions are right any mature beholder can give birth. A brood probably consists of 1-4 young beholders, and might require the body of a slain creature (perhaps even another beholder) to serve as an incubator. I suggest giving young beholders a minimum of 12 hit points—eight for the body, and four for the central eye. Infant beholders have a full complement of eyes.`,

            question: `Not long ago, my character had an accident with his spelljamming vessel—the reactor on his gnomish sidewheeler suffered a meltdown while in the phlogiston (and you know what that means). My character tried to steer the ship through a portal into Realmspace, but the ship blew up before it had exited the flow. The resulting explosion destroyed the ship, the portal, and a good portion of the crystal shell. (Fortunately, my character escaped via his ***amulet of the planes***.) Since the resulting hole in the crystal shell is going to allow the phlogiston to rush into Realmspace, would that mean that Toril will be consumed in flames? If so, how much experience does my character get when the entire population (barring fire-resistant creatures) is killed? (A number rounded to the nearest million would be okay.) Does the character receive any additional experience from escaping the wreck?`,
            answer: [
                `It's time for a few reminders about the properties of crystal shells:`,
                `First, all crystal shells are made of an unknown substance that is unbreakable; check out page 9 of the ***Concordance of Arcane Space*** (from the original SPELLJAMMER® boxed set), for more details. Mortals cannot destroy or alter crystal shells, except in the limited manner described in ***Concordance of Arcane Space***. Even a ***wish*** is ineffective. Exploding spelljamming ships aren't up to the job.`,
                `Second, crystal shells are so huge that the explosion in your example could not destroy a significant portion of even a small one. The Realmspace shell has an area of about 128,680,000,000,000,000,000 square miles (the planet earth, by contrast has a surface area of only 196,938,800 square miles). Even if the explosion created a fireball the size of the sun, the hole it would make would be a mere pinprick when compared with the size of the shell, The space inside a shell is so huge (*cosmically* huge) that time would end before enough phlogiston could leak in to flood the entire sphere, or even to threaten the outermost planets in the system.`,
                `Third, phlogiston does not tend to flow through holes in crystal shells. Every portal through a shell is a hole, but some barrier or phenomenon keeps the phlogiston out, though ships that locate the portal can pass through. Even if the explosion in your example "jammed" the portal open and allowed phlogiston to leak in, you'd probably just get a localized effect that looks just like a star embedded in the shell. Ships still could use the portal, provided their crews had enough nerve to dive into the heart of the star.`,
                `Finally, experience in the AD&D® game is awarded for success achieved in the face of a significant risk. Inadvertent destruction is not success, so even if your character had managed to incinerate all of Toril, he wouldn't be entitled to any experience for it. Your DM, however, might give the character a few experience points for surviving the wreck. How big the award is depends on the campaign, but it should be fairly small, 1,000 xp would be sufficient for a character rich and powerful enough to own a spelljammer.`

Real greek fire, on the other hand, was something like the ancient worlds version of napalm. From all the accounts I've read, it burned hotter and longer than plain oil. Like napalm, it also stuck to whatever it hit. Also like napalm, it was self igniting (no wick or fuse required).

            answer: [
                `This is entirely up to the DM. Because AD&D game vampires are by definition creatures with blood-sucking fangs, it stands to reason that anyone turned into one would develop such fangs. On the other hand, there's no reason to assume that all vampires bite their victims' necks. In central European folklore, vampires drew blood from the chest. Chinese vampires have wickedly long and sharp fingernails, which serve as their primary weapons. So a vampire in the form of a toothless old man could drain its victims in any number of ways. Note that PCs might have a hard time detecting a vampire in this rather unusual form.`,

            question: `In DRAGON® issue #193, you said rolls higher than 23 were impossible when using a ***vorpal blade***. The molydeus tanar'ri carries an axe +5 that has the powers of both a ***sword of dancing*** and ***vorpal blade***. Now, if the tanar'ri rolls a natural 20, his adjusted roll would be a 25 (which is higher than 23). Does he sever the neck with that roll?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, a roll of 20 severs the neck if the attacker has a ***vorpal blade*** and the opponent has a head. I'll reiterate my main point from issue #193 for the benefit of any reader who still is in the dark about this: an attacker armed with a ***vorpal blade*** cannot sever a neck unless the attack roll is 17 or higher. This is because the modified score to sever (see item description, ***DMG***, page 186) can include only the ***vorpal blade's*** +3 bonus, not bonuses due to Strength, situation, or specialization.`,
                `Of course, the molydeus' combination ***vorpal*** and ***dancing*** weapon introduces a few problems. For example, ***swords of dancing*** have variable bonuses, which range from +1 to +4 (see item description, ***DMG***, page 185). Further, a ***sword of dancing*** can be made to dance only on a round when its bonus has fallen to +1. Does this mean the a molydeus's axe has a "dancing" cycle that is four rounds long instead of three rounds long? The DM also must decide what happens to the ***vorpal*** effect as the axe's bonus rises and falls. The simplest solution is to assume that the axe's bonus remains steady at +5, and that the axe can dance for three rounds at a time. If you take this approach, I suggest that you ignore the effect of the +5 bonus on attack scores to sever and to assume that the weapon severs a normal opponent's neck on an attack roll of 17 + , a larger-than-man-sized opponent's neck on a roll of 18 +, and a solid metal or stone opponent's neck on a roll of 19 +.`

            question: `I'm having a real problem with a few players and their wizard characters. First, I explained that a lot of iron or steel next to the skin disrupts magic. Things were fine for awhile, but now they carry plate armor with them and insist on wearing it after they have used up all their spells.`,
            answer: [
                `This is what comes from asking too many questions about a fantasy game. Fantasy, by its very nature, deals with the inexplicable and concerns itself with the what; the why is left to philosophers, science-fiction authors, and your ever helpful "Sage Advice" columnist. My first suggestion to you is to consider the obvious: If you're assuming that large masses of metal in close proximity to a wizards body foils spells, then it is relevant to ask just how your armor-toting wizards are carrying all that armor. If they've bundled it up in a pack, guess what? It's still too close.`,
                `Actually, the situation is a little more complex than that. Character-class armor and weapon restrictions are among the few basic and unalterable rules in the AD&D® game. As always, the rule is necessary because of game balance and game logic. It's been awhile since I repeated one of my little exercises in game balance and game logic, so let's go through the game logic first:`,
                `Armor is heavy, hot, and confining. Fighters gain their various combat abilities only after undergoing long and rigorous physical training that begins in their youth. (A medieval knight's training began at age six.) This explains why they can do things like slay 30 giants using swords less than four feet long, and keep on fighting even when peppered with arrows. Wearing armor is an impressive physical feat. The stuff is hot, heavy, and generally uncomfortable. It takes a long time before a person can even bear to wear it for any length of time, much less fight or explore a dungeon while encased in it. Fighters, however, develop the ability to resist physical hardships of various kinds and can soldier on through conditions that can kill other characters.`,
                `On the other hand, wizards spend their youth and all their spare time sitting and reading. This sharpens their minds, but it does not build the kind of physical skills that fighters enjoy, even in wizards who have naturally high Strength and Constitution scores. All that sitting around and studying turns wizards into sedentary bookworms who do not have enough stamina to walk around in armor. They probably can't even walk a straight line while wearing armor—a wizard in armor probably would stagger about like a little kid carrying a sack of potatoes. Further, all that studying gives wizards an entirely different mindset than fighters have. They prefer to use their brains to attack their problems; they come to regard accoutrements such as swords and armor as crude and beneath their dignity. It's not so much that wizards *can't* wear armor, but that they *won't* armor. It's too hot, too uncomfortable, too noisy, and just downright unfashionable.`,
                `Now, on to game balance: Wizards are potentially the most powerful character class in the game. They have access to a considerable array of offensive and defensive magic and can literally lay waste to whole city blocks. The price they pay for this power is an almost complete lack of physical power. In the beginning, they are so weak that they must depend on the characters around them for support and protection. Fighters, on the other hand, don't have access to a mighty arsenal of magic. All they have is their wits, their weapons, and their equipment. As the only class with unrestricted access to both weapons and armor, they are playable, but they remain so only as long as the DM does not allow other characters to poach on their territory. Otherwise, everyone in your campaign is going to be playing an armor-clad wizard.`,
                `I suggest you sock your armor-loving wizards with any or all of the following penalties:`,
                `*Encumbrance*: Even if the characters in question have high enough Strength scores to carry the weight of the armor, knock their movement rate down to one half (two-thirds if you're feeling generous). They also should make a Dexterity check every turn or fall down and go boom. It easy to lose one's equilibrium when one is carrying an unaccustomed weight, and a wizard might easily trip. The encumbered wizard also should check Dexterity every time he tries anything that even remotely requires ability: running, jumping, using stairs (in either direction), getting on a mount, etc.`,
                `*Fatigue*: Single-classed wizards who wear armor or carry shields should make a Constitution check every turn (more often if its very cold or very hot). Failure indicates fatigue. The character must remove the armor and rest awhile. If the weather is bad, the character also must do something to cool off or warm up.`,
                `*Uncertainty*: All this reliance on physical things undermines the mental discipline the wizard needs to command his magic. There is a 25% chance that any spell he casts during the next 24 hours will fail outright. (Of course, if the character is wearing prohibited armor at the time of casting, the spell fails 100% of the time.) Further, the character gains no experience for the adventure in which he dons armor to protect himself. If he makes a habit of wearing armor, he might even lose a level or two.`

            answer: [
                `Yes, the one-two punch applies to all types of opponents. When a psionicist pays the initial PSP cost for the psychic crush science, or the ego whip, id insinuation, mind thrust, or psionic blast devotions, she gets to use the power twice, provided both attacks occur in the same round and are directed against the same opponent. Note that the psionicist must make a power check for each use.`,
                `Remember that the psionicist must take the time to establish full contact (three tangents) with the opponent, even when the opponent is not using defense modes. If the psionicist uses the one-two punch against a fully contacted mind, the results vary according to the power. If the power allows a saving throw, such as psychic crush or psionic blast, the victim must save each vs. each successful use of the power and suffers accordingly if the save fails. If the power does not allow a saving throw, two successes in the same round are not cumulative; however, the psionicist gets to use the best of the two results. For example, if the one-two punch delivers two successful uses of the id insinuation devotion, the psionicist would roll twice to see how long the opponent would remain in a moral uproar and only the highest roll would count (though the DM might let the psionicist might let the psionicist choose which roll to take).`

            answer: [
                `***Contingency*** and ***chain contingency*** spells trigger other spells. Psionics are not spells and cannot be part of a magical ***contingency***. Likewise, ***contingency*** cannot be used to trigger magical items, breath weapons, gaze attacks, or spell-like abilities.`,
                `Under some conditions, it might be possible to use a ***ring of telekinesis*** and psionic telekinesis together, but this wouldn't happen very often. If faced with an object too big to lift with the telekinesis power, a psionicist wouldn't benefit from a ***ring of telekinesis*** because he couldn't initiate the power and concentrate on using the ring at the same time. If, however, the psionicist were already moving an object and was merely maintaining the telekinesis power, he could use the ring's lifting capacity to reduce the maintenance cost. Likewise, if the object were a table and an opponent grabbed it or jumped on it, the ring could be brought into play to handle the additional weight. I suppose that a lenient DM might allow a psionicist to establish a partial "pull" on a large object, for example, spending 80 PSPs to tug at a 100-pound object, and then use a ***ring of telekinesis*** during the next round to provide the extra power. (In this case, the total PSP cost would be 120 PSPs, 80 to initiate the power, and 40 more to maintain the power on the second round vs. 150 PSPs to move the object with the telekinesis power alone).`

                `Actually, ***mind blank*** offers considerable protection against many types of psionic attacks; see the spell description (***PH***, page 190) for the list. The protection is magical, however, and psionics are not magical. This allows an attacking psionicist a saving throw vs. spells to overcome the defense. Because ***mind blank*** is an eighth-level spell, I suggest that you require a save each time a psionic uses a power against a protected character—the spell presents a formidable barrier that does not weaken even if the psionicist already has breached a few times. Note that bonuses from defensive items, such as ***rings of protection***, do not modify this save. Wisdom bonuses can apply if the DM allows them to.`,

            answer: [
                `Assuming that the party already knows where a trap is, the thief find-traps ability is already pretty much irrelevant. There is no hard and fast rule for non-thieves disarming traps by triggering them. First, the DM has to decide if a trap can be disarmed at all. There's not much anybody can do with a 10-foot pit. Then there are traps such as tripwires, that can be triggered safely as long as the character messing with it has enough reach to stay out of the way (or course, the trap might be loaded with multiple shots). Then there are traps that non-thieves might be able to disarm, such as poison needles in locks, scything blades, and the like. Any character who correctly guesses the trap's workings could have some chance to break it (by bending the needle, wedging the blade, etc.). It is best to decide the chance for success ahead of time; thieves with the remove-traps skill should get a substaneial bonus. It is also fine to salt your dungeons with a few traps that can be foiled only by thieves or utter destruction. (No matter how flexible a poison needle is, it won't work after the mage has blown the door it guards to flinders with a ***lightning bolt***.)`,

            question: `What's to prevent players from using the ***enhance*** spell from ***Legends & Lore*** to circumvent the limits on using wishes to increase ability scores? ***Wishes*** cannot raise ability scores over 16, but ***enhance*** can raise a score to 22. The wizard casting ***enhance*** loses a few points of Constitution, but ***wishes*** can be used to restore the loss. Isn't the ***enhance*** spell overpowered?`,
            answer: [
                `There's nothing in the rules to prevent PCs from doing what you've described. Note that this spell is intended for NPCs; most campaigns don't have wizard PCs of 16th level or higher running around. No matter how powerful the PCs are, most NPC wizards are not going to cast this spell for the PCs. The ***enhance*** spell-caster is going to need at least two—and possibly five or more—***wishes*** to recover lost Constitution points from each spell. If the PCs in your game have access to that many ***wishes***, you should be glad that the worst thing you have to deal with is PCs running around with ability scores of 22. Even if the PCs are using this spell themselves, the one-week rest period required after each ***enhance*** spell and the three years of magical aging for each ***wish*** spell should put the kibosh on the whole deal sooner or later. Even if you've done something silly, such as let the PCs circumvent the magical aging, a few evil NPCs and monsters showing up whenever an ***enhance*** spell goes off while the party wizard is incapacitated should persuade the PCs to find a new scam. Note also that ***wishes*** can raise an ability score higher than 16; it just takes 10 ***wishes*** to improve the ability score one point if it is higher than 16 but less than 20. If the ability score is 21 or higher it takes 20 ***wishes*** to increase the score one point (see ***DMG***, pages 11-12).`,

Note that imps will serve only lawful evil characters and some neutral evil characters; quasits will serve only chaotic evil characters and some neutral evil characters; pseudodragons will serve only good characters.

                `"Neg." means the spell has no effect at all if the subject makes a saving throw (check out page 129 of the ***PH*** for more details). "None" means the spell has no saving throw; barring magic resistance and other special protections, the spell always works on the subject. "½" means the spell works at half strength if the subject makes a saving throw; damage-inflicting spells such as ***fireball*** generally have this kind of saving throw. "Special" means that the saving throw is unusual in some way and not easily summarized. The type of saving throw might vary according to the conditions under which the spell is cast, or the saving throw might depend on the type of subject, a specific action on the subject's part, or an ability check. Whenever you see a "Special" saving throw look in the spell description for the details.`,

Page 83 of ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook*** says ***invisibility*** is an illusion and the invisible character can always see himself because he disbelieves the illusion. Which book is correct? If ***invisibility*** is an illusion, do beings with Intelligence scores of 20 or higher automatically see invisible creatures because they are immune to first- and second-level illusions? Can an *invisible* spell-caster cast a spell from a scroll, or is the scroll also invisible because it is on the character's person? If a creature makes a successful save to notice an *invisible* creature, does it actually see creature well enough to know what it looks like or does it just have a very good idea of where the *invisible* creature is?`,
            answer: [
                `The ***DMG*** is correct. Generally, the most recently published material takes precedence over older material, but in this case the ***Complete Wizard's Handbook*** is wrong. Note that not all Illusion/Phantasm spells can be disbelieved. Spells that have no saving throw, or that are negated by a normal saving throw, such as ***invisibility***, ***hypnotic pattern***, and ***mirror image***, do not use the disbelief procedures.`,
                `The ***invisibility*** spell is an illusion; as such, creatures with 20 + Intelligence scores are immune to it. Such creatures also are immune to spells such as ***mirror image***, ***blindness***. This does not, however, mean that these creatures automatically see every *invisible* creature in the AD&D universe. Naturally invisible creatures such as invisible stalkers, aerial servants, and pixies are still hidden from supra-genius creatures. The DM also might rule that magical ***invisibility*** bestowed by items such as ***dust of disappearance***, ***cloaks of elvenkind***, and maybe even ***rings of invisibility*** also work in the face of supra-genius intelligence by virtue of the magical power invested in them.`,
                `When a character becomes *invisible*, all her equipment becomes invisible with her The character could read a scroll, however by putting down the scroll and allow ing it to become visible (see the ***invisibility*** spell description in the ***PH***, page 142). The character can pick up the visible scroll and read it normally, and can make the scroll *invisible* again by tucking it into her clothing. I strongly suggest that you assume nonmagical invisibility detection merely reveals an invisible creature's outline and position. The viewer has a good idea of the creature's size and shape, and the viewer knows exactly where the creature is—well enough to attack the creature with spells and to make physical attacks without the usual -4 penalty.`

The descriptions of both the wizard and priest versions of the spell make it clear, however, that casting ***animate dead*** is not a good act and also say that only evil characters use the spell regularly.

Casting a spell is a complex and exacting mental process and if a spell-caster suddenly forgets when and why he began the process his concentration could be broken. The DM can decide that any failed save against a ***forget*** spell disrupts a spell in process, or the DM can require the victim to make a Intelligence check to correctly asses the situation and complete the spell.

Beyond that, a sha'ir might not even be able to cast a critically needed spell at the right time because the sha'ir's gen might be delayed in getting it and might not get it at all.`,
            answer: [
                `To answer your first question, any player with a smidgen of imagination and wit should consider a sha'ir, unless she has no interest in playing a spell-casting character. Apart from a few minor technical errors, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of the sha'ir's weaknesses. A sha'ir casts spells in the same amount of time as by Skip Williams any other wizard does, (***Cantrip*** has an initiative modifier of 1, slightly faster than a ***fireball's*** initiative modifier of 3.) Most sha'irs can get ***cantrip*** from their gens more quickly than they can get ***fireball***; sha'irs of 5th level or higher must wait 1d6 + 1 rounds for the first-level ***cantrip*** and 1d6 + 3 rounds for the third-level ***fireball***. Note that sha'irs of 4th level or less must wait 1d6 + 3 turns for a ***fireball*** and there is a very good chance that their gens will return empty handed; the time is measured in turns because a normal AD&D game wizard of the sha'ir's level could not normally cast the spell (see the ***Arabian Adventures*** book, page 98). Note that a sha'ir who has acquired and cast a ***cantrip*** spell can freely create minor spell effects for as long as the spell lasts (one hour per caster level) just as any other wizard can—the gen doesn't have to go and get each individual effect.`,
                `The sha'ir has other advantages that make the kit very attractive to thoughtful players of any persuasion. Role-players should jump at the chance to play out the relationship between a sha'ir and his gen. Encounters with merchants are likely to take on a new flavor if the party sha'ir recognizes genie craftsmanship in the goods offered for sale. As the sha'ir rises in level, the player can look forward to forging alliances with genies of all sorts; constructing a genie prison and negotiating terms with the genie who is to occupy it would be a noteworthy event in any campaign.`,
                `Power gamers should absolutely drool over a sha'ir. (Boy, I can hear the howls of protest even as I type this, so don't bother writing in, just read on.) I haven't forgotten your objection to the delay sha'irs must endure once they've sent their gens to get spells. Frankly, this isn't a terrible problem for any player who has gotten beyond the ***fireball***-everything-that-moves theory of play.`,
                `Consider this: A sha'ir never runs out of spells. It is true that many encounters will be over before a sha'ir's gen can bring even a first-level spell. But PC wizards who are in the habit of tossing out spells every melee round are going run out of spells sooner or later—probably sooner. Once a standard wizard's allotment of spells are gone, the character has very little to contribute to the adventure unless he has a wand, staff, scroll, or other magical item that can produce spell-like effects.`,
                `A sha'ir's ability to keep sending his gen for an unending supply of spells is incredibly potent. A 5th-level mage can carry only seven spells at time (4 first-, 2 second-, and 1 third-level spell); that means he has only seven rounds of ammunition when a fight starts. If the character casts preparatory spells on himself, such as ***shield***, ***strength***, and ***detect invisibility***, nearly half his arsenal is gone. Truly useful but unspectacular spells such as ***fly*** and ***haste*** come at the cost of the character's one "big gun," ***fireball*** or ***lightning bolt***. Now consider a 5th-level sha'ir; all he needs is a little time and he can cast a ***strength*** spell on every fighter in the party. He also can make everybody ***fly***. Then, he can cast a ***shield***, and a ***detect invisibility*** on himself. Later, if the party needs ***knock*** or a ***detect magic***, spell the gen can just go get them. The sha'ir might not be able to pour in the firepower during a fight, but he can prepare for a fight by sending his gen out for a potent spell, such as ***fireball***, ahead of time. If the sha'ir doesn't cast the spell right away, he can hold it for up to 30 minutes before using it. In this manner, he can pretty much always have one spell ready to cast.`,
                `The sha'ir's bag of tricks still isn't exhausted. If he's willing to wait a few turns, he can try for a fourth- or fifth-level spell such as ***polymorph self***, ***fire shield***, or ***teleport***. The spell might not ever arrive, but most players will admit that it's nice to have a chance to get it. Also note that sha'irs can use any magical item a wizard can use, so a sha'ir can fall back on scrolls, wands, and the like while the gen is away, just as a normal wizard does when the spells run out.`,
                `In any case, players do not have to be out of their minds to play sha'irs, but they do have to be willing to use their heads.`

Vampires can regenerate, and regain hit points fairly quickly. Other undead can recover hit points by resting, just like living creatures do (probably by absorbing negative energy and using it to reconstruct their bodies). The DM is free to decide how quickly hit points are recovered, but I suggest a maximum of one hit point every 24 hours. Note that healing spells do not work on non-living creatures, as "Sage Advice" pointed out last month. I strongly suggest you extend this limitation to include ***potions of healing***, ***Keoghtom's ointment***, and similar items.

                `Before somebody asks, a spectre rendered powerless by daylight can only move. It cannot attack or drain levels. Because it hates light so much, a spectre must try to move to a dark place; it can't go joyriding in the sunlight.`

If a lich casts enough ***wish*** spells, it eventually "dies" and falls into dust. Note also that casting a ***wish*** spell forces the character to rest in bed for 2d4 days. A lich must rest in its tomb for the required time after casting a ***wish***. Because this leaves the lich vulnerable to attack, I doubt that liches cast ***wish*** spells very often.`,
                `Because liches once were living characters, it's a good bet that they have a Constitution score, which is determined by rolling 3d6 or whatever method the campaign employs. The DM is free to decide what effect the lich's transformation into an undead creature has on the Constitution score. It might be reduced (dead people are not at all well), or it might be increased (dead creatures can pretty much ignore injuries that would imperil a living creature, and they don't have to worry about getting sick).

I'd hold the additions down to one new weapon for druids, maybe two if a PC druid from your game actually visited Athas and came back home to tell the tale. Looking over the three weapons on your list, I'm inclined to eliminate cahu- laks first because they are the most unlike the weapons already on the druids list. The bard's friend seems to be something like a dagger, albeit more complicated. There's no reason druids couldn't use metal versions of this weapon; they're allowed to use metal daggers and scimitars after all. I have doubts about tortoise blades. Essentially, a tortoise blade is a combination weapon and shield, which doesn't strike me as very druidical.

The outlines don't glow like neon signs; it takes a long, careful look to discover one. I suggest one turn to search a 10' x 10' area for outlines. No die roll is required—if a planer looks in the right place she finds the portal—but the character must make a special effort.

                `Priest spells are not common knowledge to sha'irs; a sha'ir cannot send his gen after a priest spell until he has witnessed it being used at least once. Sha'irs are not priests and always risk divine displeasure if they decide to try casting priest spells. In the case of devout sha'irs, it's best to assume that is the sha'ir's own deity that takes him to task if he is caught meddling with priest spells—the deities of the Land of Fate take care of their own.`,

            question: `The ***DMG*** says that flying creatures have a daily movement rate in miles equal to twice their flying speed if the air is calm. The world map in the new COUNCIL OF WYRMS™ setting has a scale of 50 miles per hex. Most dragons have a flying rate of 30, so they can fly a little more than one hex a day. How can the dragons in this world ever answer a call to council in the required 15 days?`,
            answer: [
                `I was party to a discussion of this very problem while the COUNCIL OF WYRMS box was in production. The solution goes something like this: The movement rate in the ***DMG*** assumes a 10-hour day at a moderate pace with stops for food and rest. Dragons, being fantastically strong fliers, can stay aloft for 20 hours a day with no stops at all. This yields a daily movement rate of 10 times the basic move, or six hexes a day for a dragon with a flying speed of 30. That's more than enough to allow any dragon to reach the Council Aerie in 15 days no matter where it starts on the map. An oversight caused this solution to be excluded from the final version of the manuscript.`,
                `I suggest you treat this kind of extended dragon flight as a type of forced march (see ***PH***, page 120). Note that dragons can fly five times their basic movement rate in miles per day (three hexes for a dragon with a flight speed of 30) and avoid the daily Constitution check. You should assume that the oceans surrounding the Io's Blood island chain are dotted with landing places too small to appear on the map. Any dragons can pause at one of these for a quick nap and snack whenever the need arises. I suggest that you allow a dragon who is trying to answer a summons to council to ignore one failed saving throw during the trip for each age category it has. After the flight ends, a dragon must sleep one day for each day of extended flying, plus one week (15 days in a dragon's reckoning) for each failed saving throw. The dragon can postpone the sleep for one week per age category, which should allow it to attend all the council before it has to doze off.`

                `I enjoy "Sage Advice" very much, but I feel I must reply to some of issue #204's letters myself. First you claimed that beholders procreate by means of parthenogenesis. However, on page 69 of the ***Lorebook of the Void*** in the SPELLJAMMER® boxed set very clear reference is made to a beholder "hive mother" or ultimate beholder; this implies a gender distinction. Also, you pointed out all the errors in the letter about the exploding gnomish sidewheeler except the most glaring one: an ***amulet of the planes*** won't work in the Flow because alternate planes are inaccessible. The character, far from gaining 1,000 xp, should be radioactive toast. You shouldn't get soft on character death through stupidity just because you're writing for the April issue.`,
                `By the way, can the Mists of Ravenloft reach into the Flow even though access to other planes is restricted?`
            ],
            answer: [
                `I "claim" nothing about beholders. In issue #204 I merely pointed out what the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL*** tome says about beholder reproduction (see page 22). The ***MM*** material is only speculation, the exact nature of beholder reproduction is unrevealed. In any case, your single line from ***Lorebook of the Void*** hardly disproves the parthenogenetic reproduction theory. In fact a "hive mother" is not a female beholder, but a type of beholder-kin (see ***MM***, page 25). Note that the term "hive mother" doesn't necessarily imply that beholders have genders—it's just a name. George Washington is known as the father of our country, but that does not mean that he and Martha are still having bambinos. Also note that any parthenogenetic creature could literally be a "mother" because it is capable of producing offspring. Such a creature is not female in the traditional sense of the term because it reproduces without assistance or interference from others of its kind.`,
                `Regarding exploding gnomish sidewheelers: I'm sorry, I think overlooking a crystal sphere's sheer size and volume is the most glaring error here. As far as escaping via an ***amulet of the planes***, you are right, the amulet shouldn't work in the Flow any more than a ***plane shift*** or similar spell would. But, the sidewheeler was exiting the Flow at the time of the explosion. I have you at a slight disadvantage, because the edited version of the letter didn't make that altogether clear. So, while the ship wasn't exactly in Wildspace, it wasn't really in the Flow either. More importantly, I think it's a very bad idea for a DM to reverse a decision that allowed a player character to survive a bad situation. Campaigns begin to crumble when players are jumping for joy over a miraculous escape and the DM poops the party by telling them their characters are dead after all. It would have been fine for the DM to warn the player never to count on saving his gnome from explosions in the Flow via an ***amulet of the planes*** again, but the ruling should be allowed to stand— lucky flukes happen to PCs from time to time—that's why they're heroes.`,
                `I'm inclined to think that the Mists of Ravenloft do not extend into the Flow. Characters who commit despicable acts are not necessarily safe, however. The Dark Powers are canny, and the Mists could be waiting for evildoers upon their return to Wildspace.`

If, on the other hand, one were to find a petitioner's mortal remains, one can use ***speak with dead*** on them and get a normal result, provided that the creature has not been dead longer than the spell allows. A ***speak with dead*** spell doesn't give the caster a hotline to the petitioner (as you point out, that would be useless). Instead, ***speak with dead*** is a divination spell that allows the caster to learn things that a particular dead creature knew in life.

When a creature detects the scrying, it detects this sensor. When a ***dispel magic*** spell is used to disrupt scrying, the sensor is the spell's target. The sensor always appears in a location that gives an unobstructed view of the subject. The DM can decide how far away from the subject the sensor will be, but it should be close enough to allow the viewer to see details, say 5-30' distant. Assume the view is similar to a closely focused photograph; the viewer can see the subject and any creature or object in its immediate vicinity. The view behind the subject is murky and indistinct.

                `Generally, a gen can go fetch spells for its master from any place in the multiverse. The gen's starting location has no measurable effect on how long it takes to fetch a spell, because most of the gen's time is spent locating and negotiating for the spell, not actually traveling from place to place. The DM can rule that local conditions prevent the gen from leaving the plane, but this should be very rare. If the plane the gen is on allows access to the Ethereal or Astral Planes, it always can fetch spells. Even when it cannot directly enter the Astral or Ethereal, the gen probably can find a conduit or gate that will get it where it needs to go. Note that a gen's ability to go plane hopping does not apply to the sha'ir or to the sha'ir's companions.`,

The spell, however, still fails when the sha'ir tries to cast it because fire spells are ineffective on the Elemental Plane of Water.`

The ***Bigby's hand*** spells cannot damage golems, but they can slow them or move them around if the golem falls within the spells weight limits. ***Mordenkainen's sword*** is ineffective against golems.

            question: `Would a thief's backstabbing attack always qualify as an ambush as defined on page 111 of the ***Player's Handbook***? What about surprise? Would the thief automatically gain surprise if she wasn't seen and made a successful move silently roll?`,
            answer: [
                `The penalties for being ambushed (no chance for a return attack *and* roll for surprise to see if the ambusher gets a another free round of attacks with surprise) do not always apply to the victim of a thief's backstab attack. To qualify as an ambush, the ambusher must be aware of her victim and prepare her attack ahead of time. In addition, the target must be unable to detect the foe prior to the attack. For example, a thief who hears a monster approaching, successfully hides in shadows until the monster passes, then successfully moves silently and closes to the attack probably deserves to be credited with an ambush. On the other hand, a thief who turns a corner and finds herself facing an opponent's unguarded back should be allowed to make a backstab attack, but cannot stage an ambush.`,
                `Technically, a thief must surprise an opponent before she can claim any backstab bonuses (see ***PHB***, page 40); that is, the backstab *requires* surprise, it does not guarantee it. Note that an unseen thief who makes a successful move silently roll has an extra chance to achieve surprise, see ***DMG***, table 57, page 102; the target should suffer a -2 penalty for the thief's silent movement and very likely an additional -2 for not seeing the thief lurking behind.`,
                `In any case, most DMs I know dispense with the surprise roll and allow a backstab anytime a thief makes an attack from behind against an opponent who is unaware of the thief and has no compelling reason to suspect a rear attack. In such cases, I still recommend a normal surprise roll. If the victim is surprised, the thief gets two attacks before there is an initiative roll. The thief's first attack gains the backstab bonuses and the second attack is a normal rear attack. If the surprise roll fails, the thief is assumed to win initiative and gets the backstab bonuses for the first attack and the victim and turn around and return the attack if she survives.`

                `On the other hand, ***detect magic*** reveals magical emanations within the area of effect. Now, I don't find anything in the ***charm person***, ***charm person or mammal***, ***suggestion***, ***mass charm***, ***fire charm***, or ***charm monster*** spell descriptions implying that any of these spells do not produce magical emanations just like any other spell does.`,
                `Let's pause for a moment, however, and examine what ***detect magic*** can and can- not do. ***Detect magic*** can detect magical emanations from a charmed creature. If a priest casts the spell, all it reveals is the approximate strength magic, weak to overwhelming; the priest who cast the spell learns nothing else. If a wizard casts the ***detect magic*** spell, there is a 10% chance per caster level of identifying the exact type of magic; in this case, Enchantment/Charm magic, not ***charm person*** or any other specific effect. Note that this kind of accuracy is not always possible. The percentile roll to determine the type of magic can fail and the DM can rule that there are so many conflicting types of magic present that no one of them can be singled out. This might very well be the case if the charmed character also is carrying several magical items, has consumed a potion, and has also has received some other type of spell.`,
                `***Detect charm*** exists as a separate spell for two reasons. First, it allows priests to identify magical charms when they find them; something that their version of ***detect magic*** cannot do. Second, it allows a magical charm to be identified exactly, right down to the specific type—it can distinguish a ***charm person*** effect from a ***rod of beguiling*** effect even when there are several different types of magic affecting the creature being examined; something that not even the wizard's version of ***detect magic*** can do.

            answer: [
                `A *charmed* creature regards the spell-caster as a valued friend who will never harm it or tell it a lie. The creature also loses all sense of personal initiative and does nothing unless the caster tells it to do something (see DMG, pages 63-64). It is possible for the caster to persuade the *charmed* creature to attack former comrades, but the caster's intention must be clear and the caster might need to be very insistent if the *charmed* creature is lawful or good and is loyal to its original group. Such communication is seldom possible in the midst of combat, though the caster can draw the *charmed* creature aside for a chat. Note that if the *charmed* creature's associates try to prevent the creature from leaving the group, it becomes much easier for the caster to convince the creature that the former allies are enemies.`,

            question: `I'm running a COUNCIL OF WYRMS™ campaign with five different types of dragon PCs. Several characters (the crystal, sapphire, and copper dragons) have gained enough experience to go up a level, while the rest (the gold and silver dragons) are still a long way from going up. The first group of players don't want to wait for the required time to lapse and the second group wants harder adventures so they can get more experience. What can I do? Is there a way to speed up or slow down the characters' advancement rates? Is the time requirement really necessary?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, the time requirement is necessary—being a dragon isn't easy. The simplest solution to your problem is to use the Player Character Sets rules (***Book One***, page 35). Let the players with dragons ready to go up levels temporarily retire their characters (or better yet become involved on dragon politics or other campaign business) and have those players use their kindred characters for adventures while the remaining dragons collect the experience and treasure they need to advance. There are other solutions, but how well they work depends on how competitive your players are. If your players are dedicated role-players, you simply can advance the campaign timeline a few decades or centuries whenever you feel the need and promote all the PCs to the next level.`,

An individual class award can be given in addition to the group award or instead of the group award, depending on how the DM feels about the situation.

                `A character can carry as much equipment as his encumbrance limit allows (see ***PHB***, Table 1, page 14). Capacities for common containers are given in the ***PHB*** as well (see Table 50, page 78); a backpack holds 50 pounds and a large belt pouch holds 8 pounds.`,

Generally speaking, a character can carry one size M weapon (such as a long sword or a battle axe) on one hip, and a size S weapon (such as a hand axe or short sword) on the other hip. A bandolier over a man-sized character's torso can hold about three size S weapons, and a character who really wants to be armed to the teeth probably can carry two or three very compact size S weapons, such as daggers, strapped to each leg (bulkier weapons such as short swords and war hammers can't be this way if the character wants to walk normally).`,

One two-handed weapon can be strapped across a man-sized character's back, but the character is going to have a very hard time getting at it quickly. You can figure the character is going to blow a whole round getting the weapon loose, and that is possible only if the character has taken the care to lash it carefully and provide some kind of snap or hook at the shoulder so that the weapon can be pulled loose quickly.

            answer: [

                `What was I thinking? Why, I was thinking about what the rules say. In the both versions of the AD&D game, a character who has a magical war hammer of any kind, any ***girdle of giant strength***, and ***gauntlets of ogre power*** gains the ability to do the Thor routine and really smash up the opposition by adding up the combat bonuses from all the items and the character's normal Strength score bonus to boot. The fateful line of text that makes this possible can be found on page 145 of the original ***DMG*** and on page 170 of the current ***DMG***. Bonuses from a ***potion of giant strength*** are never added into this bonanza of combat bonuses (a potion being neither girdle nor gauntlet, nor normal). Note that a character must have all three items, girdle, gauntlets, and war hammer, to get the super bonus. So, if the DM only give out two of three items, no PC in the game can get the combined bonuses.`,
                `Are the combined bonuses scary? Well, scary is a relative term. Even your +9/+16 tactical nuke on legs is likely to take pause if she meets something that just doesn't care about how much damage an opponent can inflict. A vampire wizard using a ***fire shield*** spell might just ruin the tactical nuke's day, even if the vampire only gets to stick around for a round or two before being forced into gaseous form or being turned by the party priest.`,
                `In case you're not quite following me here, remember that vampires just don't care much about damage that doesn't come in the form of sharpened stakes in the heart; other forms of damage just force them into gaseous form until they can regenerate the damage. Also remember that ***fire shield*** spells turn physical attacks into magical zaps that inflict just as much damage on the attacker as the attacker inflicts on the target. So every time the character hits for mega-damage she also suffers mega-damage.`,
                `No, to really "scare" me you'd have to add a ***ring of vampiric regeneration***, ***armor of etherealness***, and a ***cloak of displacement*** to the tactical nuke. Now there's a character that could make the tarrasque think about retiring and taking up collectible card games.`,
                `The moral of the story is DMs should be careful when handing out magical treasures, especially ***girdles of giant strength*** and magical war hammers (even ***war hammers +1***). If you find that your players have used their characters' magical items to create killing machines that really scare you, it's time to start thinking about what might scare the killing machines. (What would happen to the PCs if the spell-casting vampire had two or three *hasted* pet rust monsters and had dropped a few ***phase door*** spells in strategic locations?)`

            question: `Wizards using the ghul lord kit from the ***Complete Sha'ir's Handbook*** have an ability called manipulation, which inflicts temporary damage on the user. What is temporary damage? Also, there is a reference to a process called "leaching" that allows the character to use magical items to avoid the hit point loss, but leaching is never explained.`,
            answer: [
                `The damage a ghul lord suffers from a manipulation comes from the negative energy the character uses to power the manipulation. It is temporary only insofar as it can be healed by rest or spells—the character does not lose hit points permanently.`,
                `Leaching is a complete mystery to me, but here's a suggestion: Defensive items, such as ***rings of protection***, ***cloaks or protection***, and ***bracers of defense***, can block the damage. Each of an item's plusses stops one point of damage; ***bracers of defense*** have one effective plus for each point of armor class improvement they bestow beyond armor class 10, so, for example, ***bracers of defense AC 4*** count as +6 items. A ghul lord carrying several defensive items can choose which one to leach during any particular manipulation. If the manipulation is particularly powerful, the ghul lord can leach multiple items to block all the damage. A leached magical item becomes nonmagical for 1d4 melee rounds no matter how much damage it blocked. Each time an item is leached, it must save vs. magical fire or be destroyed in a wave of negative energy.`

            question: `Exactly how does a wizard using the Mystic of Nog kit (from the ***CSH***) sacrifice spell levels when maintaining the *hands of stone* power? I understand that the character must devote one spell level to the power each time he advances a level, but the kit description says that spells have to be expended in whole spell units, you can't spend part of a 3rd-level spell to get a power that costs only one or two spell levels. So, only a 1st level spell slot can be used to maintain *hands of stone*. What happens to a Mystic of Nog when he gains a level and does not also gain a 1st-level spell slot? Also, the kit description mentions that an ability score can be raised higher than 18 temporarily. How long does the temporary increase last and how does the character pay for it?`,
            answer: [
                `If a Mystic of Nog character doesn't have a 1st-level spell slot available to spend on maintaining the *hands of stone* power, he can't maintain the power and suffers the consequences (1d6 points of damage to the character every time he uses *hands of stone*). Players who choose this power for their characters should plan ahead and make sure that sufficient 1st level spell slots are available. If the DM is feeling kind, the PC may use the power at a lower level if the maintenance cost can't be paid. For example, an 8th-level Mystic of Nog inflicts 1d4 +4 hp damage with *hands of stone* (1d4 + half the character's level, rounded up). If the character advances to 9th level, he could inflict 1d4 + 5 hp damage. If the character cannot maintain the power, the DM might allow him to inflict 1d4 + 4 hp damage with no damage to himself. If the DM was feeling really kind, he might allow the character to delay the maintenance cost for several levels and make up the deficit with a higher level spell slot. For instance, the character from the previous example might not pay any maintenance for his *hands of stone* power until he reaches, say, 11th level. Under the suggested rule, his *hands of stone* power still would inflict 1d4 +4 hp damage, but if he sacrificed a 3rd-level spell slot upon reaching 11th level the ability would be properly maintained and would inflict 1d4 + 6 hp damage.`,
                `I recommend that temporarily increasing an ability score above 18 cost five spell levels per point of increase. The spell levels should be taken from the slots the character normally has available for casting spells and are not lost permanently. The increase lasts one day or until the character rests and studies spells again.`

            answer: [
                `Most proficiencies require a check against a relevant ability score if the DM decides there is a chance of failure. Speaking a language can require a check against the PC's unmodified Intelligence score (see ***PHB***, Table 37). Deciding whether a proficiency requires a success roll always is a judgment call on the DM's part. In the case of a language, no check is required when native speakers are conversing. If the circumstances are difficult, such as when a non-native speaker first hears an unfamiliar dialect or a character has to do some fast talking in a non-native language, the DM might call for a success roll to determine whether the speaker stumbles over a phrase or otherwise misspeaks. A success roll might also be required when a non-native speaker tries to get vital information out of a native speaker who is excited or distracted (did he say run to the back or the runt is back?).`,

            question: `According to ***The Book of Artifacts*** (page 124), a wizard needs a ***permanency*** spell and an ***enchant an item*** spell to create a permanent magical item. Because the ***permanency*** spell is 8th level, a wizard with an Intelligence score of 15 or less cannot learn it (see ***PHB***, Table 4) and cannot make permanent magical items. Is that right? Also, if the wizard were a half-elf, the character would have to have a 19 Intelligence or he could not reach 16th level, which is the first level in which a wizard can learn an 8th level spell. Right? Finally, if the wizard is an abjurer, invoker, or necromancer, the character cannot make permanent magical items because one of the two required spells falls in the character's opposition schools. (Abjurers cannot learn ***permanency***, an alteration; and invokers and necromancers cannot learn ***enchant an item***, an enchantment/charm.)`,
            answer: [
                `You are almost right on all three counts.`,
                `Yes, a wizard needs both an ***enchant an item*** and a ***permanency*** spell to create a permanent magical item.`,
                `Yes, a wizard must be at least 16th level to learn and cast ***permanency***, which is an 8th-level spell available only to wizards with Intelligence scores of 16 or higher and access to the alteration school.

                `Yes, a half-elf wizard needs an Intelligence score of 19 or more to reach 16th level (if the campaign is using the Exceeding Level Limits optional rule).`,
                `But no rule says a character who is creating a magical item has to cast all the required spells himself. The character can get another character to cast the spells for him, read the spells from scrolls, or use a ***wish*** to duplicate a spell's effects. Remember that any wizard can read wizard spells from scrolls, even spells from a specialist's opposition schools. (This a special property of magical scrolls and an important exception to the general rule that prevents specialists from employing magical items that produce effects from their opposition schools.) Also, "Sage Advice" suggested last month that it's okay to add ***enchant an item*** to the evocation/invocation school. You can use the same logic to put ***permanency*** into the evocation/invocation school, too, but that's beginning to stretch things a bit.`,

            question: `The item description for a ***vorpal blade*** says the sword can sever the head of a larger-than-man-sized opponent on a modified roll of 21-23. Now, in the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL™*** tome there is a size category for creatures called "larger than man-sized," covering creatures 7'-12' tall. The players in my game were very annoyed when I ruled that their ***vorpal blade*** could not sever the heads of huge or gargantuan opponents such as dragons. My players argue that the sword can sever any creature's head, and that the number to sever the head of any creature larger than a man is 21-23. I contend that the sword can't sever the heads of creatures more than 12' tall. I don't think that a 3' sword ought to be able to slice the head off a creature with a neck 10' thick.`,
            answer: [
                `Technically, your players are right. The phrase "larger than man-sized" in the item description refers to any creature bigger than a normal human, not just size Large creatures. This kind of usage is common throughout the game. For example, most weapons have two damage ratings, one for small or man-sized opponents and one for larger opponents. In this case, "small or man-sized" refers to size Tiny, Small, and Man-sized creatures; "larger" refers to size Large, Huge, and Gargantuan creatures.`,
                `Nevertheless, you are free to employ whatever house rules you think are reasonable. For example, if one reads the rules literally, a character armed with a ***vorpal blade*** and standing in a pit could behead a storm giant standing on the floor outside the pit—even if all the character could reach was the giant's big toe. Does that seem silly or illogical? I think so. On the other hand, magic does not have to be reasonable or logical.`,
                `Magic is fantastic and can bring about all kinds of effects without any logical physical causes—a spell that can turn a griffon into a goldfish isn't at all logical. It may be that when a ***vorpal blade*** severs a neck there is a brilliant magical flash and a cloud of smoke. When the smoke clears, there's the opponent's head lying on the ground; the sword might not even be bloodstained. And there's nothing wrong with that if that is the kind of game you want to run.`,
                `I suggest, however, that you allow ***vorpal blades*** to sever any opponent's neck only when there is a reasonable chance that a blow from the sword could touch the opponent's neck at some time during the melee round. For example, if a character hacks at the tip of a sleeping dragon's tail, the creature's head is many feet away, and there is no chance to sever its neck. On the other hand, if the dragon is trying to bite the character wielding the ***vorpal blade*** its neck is within reach at least some of the time. Remember that combat in the AD&D game is abstract; a ***vorpal blade*** doesn't necessarily cleave off a creature's head in a single blow. The character might strike the target's neck several times during the course of the round. Or perhaps the sword does strike off a head with a single swipe—there's nothing that says that a ***vorpal blade*** can't temporarily grow to an enormous length to get the job done or that it can't emit a plane of magical force that does the really heavy duty cutting.`

            answer: [
                `Humanoid thieves certainly can backstab man-sized opponents, but some restrictions apply. Being smaller than an opponent can interfere with backstabbing because the thief can't always reach a vital area; this is seldom a problem if the thief is bigger than the opponent. Like any other thief, a humanoid thief must weild a melee weapon from the thief weapon list (club, dagger, knife, broad sword, long sword, short sword, or staff) when backstabbing.`,

Most of the larger races have no modifiers to the move silently ability, and several actually get bonuses to the hide in shadows ability—thief abilities are the products of skill and training, not size. However, large creatures's size might be a handicap in some situations. For example, a minotaur might have a hard time moving silently through a forest where its head brushes against overhanging branches. The DM must handle these situations on a case-by-case basis.`

            question: `Your answer to the question about elven archers in issue #215 was helpful, but I have a few more questions. The rules say that the elven archer can choose only long sword, short sword, and dagger as melee weapons at the start. Does the - 1 attack penalty apply to these weapons? Does the - 1 attack penalty apply to these weapons if they are not chosen until later in the archer's career (such as at 3rd level when the PC gains another weapon proficiency)? The rules also say that elven archers don't get attack bonuses when using melee weapons. Does this include bonuses from magical weapons? Artifact weapons? Weapons of quality? Do archers get damage bonuses from high Strength scores or magic? Can an archer specialize in a melee weapon to get the extra attacks and maybe the damage bonus?`,
            answer: [
                `Reading the kit description strictly, I'm inclined to suggest that an elven archer suffers a - 1 attack penalty with any melee weapon he chooses as part of his initial weapon selection, which is limited to the three weapons listed above. Attack bonuses from a high Strength score are not negated, but the - 1 penalty applies. Damage bonuses of any kind are never affected. So an archer with a Strength score of 18/51 wielding a long sword has a + 2 attack bonus and a + 3 damage bonus.

If an item could absorb a disease, what would the effect on the item be? The Switch Personality science causes the bodies that receive new personalities to degenerate, causing a loss of Constitution.

If the item is acting independently, it cannot use such powers. In the case of Switch Personality, the personality of the item's user switches with the subject's and both bodies lose Constitution normally. Likewise, hit points gained by Life Draining are transferred to the item's user. Hit points lent by Lend Health are drained from item's user. A character who uses a psionic item to absorb a disease gets the disease himself.`,

A spell such as ***stoneskin***, which protects the recipient from physical attacks, is never subject to magic resistance. ***Protection from evil*** is sometimes subject to magic resistance. Only when the spell's third effect (which forms a barrier against planar and conjured creatures and forces such creatures to recoil) comes into play does magic resistance have any affect on the spell. The spell's other two effects, which make the spell's recipient harder to hurt, are not subject to magic resistance (though if a magic resistence roll suceeds against the the third effect the whole spell collapses). For example, a leprechaun has a formidable magic resistance, but because a leprechaun is not hedged out by the spell (because it is not a conjured or planar creature), its magic resistance does not affect ***protection from evil*** spells.`,

Does a wizard who has detected spells being stolen automatically know who the jackal is? How often can a jackal steal spells?`,
            answer: [
                `Judging from the kit description, I suggest that a wizard who detects a jackal's spell theft can look at the jackal and know that character has stolen spells. This ability should last as long as the jackal is actually stealing spells and for one round thereafter per level of the victim. For example, an 11th-level victim could recognize a jackal who stole his spells for as long as the spell stealing went on and for 11 rounds thereafter. The wizard can study one other character each round when attempting to detect a jackal who has stolen his spells. Spell stealing requires concentration, which probably makes a jackal stand out in a crowd. Also, a jackal might notice when a victim begins searching.

If the character's Strength check succeeds, add the listed number to the roll before the two rolls are compared. For example, Rikard uses his large shield to rush Jon. Rikard's Strength score is 16 and Jon's is 17. If Rikard hits, there is an opposed Strength roll to see if a knockdown occurs. Rikard rolls an 8, a success; Jon rolls a 10, also a success. Normally Jon would win the roll because he succeeded with a roll higher than his opponents. Rikard's large shield, however, gives him a +3 to his check, so his roll is effectively an 11, which is high enough to win. Note that if Rikard had rolled a 16, he still would have succeeded with his Strength check and his effective score would be a 19 for purposes of resolving the opposed Strength check. If Rikard had rolled a 17 or higher, he would have failed his Strength check and would have fallen down himself.`

            answer: [
                `Both of these statements are false. First, everyone rolls initiative normally, and the side with the lowest roll wins. It is possible, however, to win initiative and still not strike first. For example, a hill giant armed with a club has a base initiative of slow and has a weapon speed of fast. Any creature's attack, however, comes during its base phase or its weapon's phase, whichever is *worse*. So, will a giant always strike after a human, whose base initiative is fast? Not necessarily. A human armed with a fast weapon, such as a dagger, usually will strike before a giant. The human also would go first if armed with an average weapon, such as a long sword. If the human has a slow weapon, however, such as a two-handed sword, he is as slow as the giant, and the initiative roll determines who goes first when two opponents act in the same phase. Even if the human has a fast or average weapon, the giant still won't always strike second. Its superior reach allows it to guard or charge and automatically strike first, no matter what its initiative roll is. If the human gets in nice and close so the giant can't guard or charge, the giant can always overrun the human (and maybe half the human's party in the process) and move off someplace where it can guard or charge the next round.`,
                `A human armed with a dagger usually will strike before a human armed with a long sword (a fast character with a fast weapon strikes before a fast character with an average weapon) unless the character armed with a long sword is charging or guarding. Before you decide that daggers are the weapon of choice, take another look at the weapons' damage ratings and knockdown numbers and at the critical hit rules. The swordsman is going to win over the long run. Note that if you interpret the rules strictly, a character armed with a dagger always strikes first when charging or guarding against a character of the same size armed with a long sword, because both weapons have the same melee reach. Use some common sense and let the swordsman go first.`,
                `In discussing this last point with ***C&T*** co-author Rich Baker, we came up the following general rule, which we both agreed should have been in the book in the first place: In a situation where a character is charging or guarding against an opponent with a weapon that has the same reach, the figure with the large weapon (or the larger creature) goes first. For example, a human swordsman guarding against a human attacker armed with a dagger goes first. A troll guarding against a human attacker with a dagger also goes first because it is a large creature guarding against a small weapon.`

Smaller creatures generally are quicker to react than bigger ones are, even when what they're doing is purely mental. Besides, if a baku really gets annoyed with a brain mole that keeps beating him to the punch, the baku can always overrun the brain mole and stomp it into the dirt. Note that many psionic abilities don't happen until a round's resolution phase. If a power has a preparation time of a round or more, it's among the last things to take effect. If you don't want to stick psionicists with acting on their base initiative phase all the time, you can make psionic powers with preparation times of fast or very fast. Or, you can roll 1d10 to determine the power's base phase. This reflects the ever changing state of the psionicist's mind and helps keep the players guessing about what's going to happen from phase to phase.`,

To determine the creature's scores, look up the monster's entry in the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL*** tome or the ***MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM®*** tome and note its general intelligence rating. A parenthetical note right next to the rating tells give you a range of mental ability scores. For example, a ki-rin has an intelligence rating of supra-genius, giving in a rating of 19-20 in both Wisdom and Intelligence. You can roll 1d6 to determine the exact score (1-3= 19, 4-6=20). Once you have the scores, calculate its MAC using table 74 (***S&P***, page 144) just like you would for a character. If a particular ki-rin has a Wisdom of 19 and an Intelligence of 20, its MAC would be 3. If you want a wider range of scores for the creature, you'll find tables for generating creature's ability scores in Chapter 2 of the ***DUNGEON MASTER™ Option: High-Level Campaigns*** book, pages 58-61.

            question: `How do you decide if a grenade-like missile strikes its target? I've looked in both the ***PHB*** and the ***DMG*** and I could find nothing that says what attack number a grenade-like missile uses.`,
            answer: [
                `A grenade-like missile's actual attack number varies according to the circumstances. If a creature is not the target and the character is within short range (10' for a flask of oil or other lightweight object) of the target point, a hit should be automatic. For example, if a character wants to smash a flask of oil at the top of a staircase the party has just ascended, the flask should land where the character wants it to as long as the target point is within 10' of the character. If the character is rushed, or the target point is farther way than 10', treat the target point as Armor Class 10 and apply the appropriate range modifier. (In the core rules, a thrown oil flask has a medium range of 20' and a long range of 30'.)`,
                `If the grenade-like missile target is a creature, the attack number depends on what the missile is. If the missile is something like a boulder or a container holding a fairly small amount of liquid that has to make direct contact with the target creature to have any effect (such as a vial of acid or holy water), then just use the creature's armor class and resolve the grenade toss as you would any other missile attack (except that you would roll for scatter if the attack misses).`,
                `If the grenade-like missile holds a fairly hefty amount of material, such as a flask of oil, I suggest rolling an attack vs. armor class 7, adjusted for the target's Dexterity score and movement rate; I suggest +3 for stationary targets, -3 for targets moving a rate faster than 3 but slower than 12, and -6 for targets moving at a rate of 12 or greater. Normal range adjustments apply in any case.`

Elven and half-elven resistance to sleep and charm spells applies to most spells, and spell-like effects that cause the subject to fall asleep or fall under another character's continuing influence. Such effects include: ***charm monster***, ***charm person***, ***charm person or mammal***, ***domination***, ***eyebite*** (charm effect only, the sleep effect works normally on elves and half-elves, as do the fear and sicken effects), ***fire charm***, ***mass charm***, and ***sleep***. Magical devices and creature special attacks that duplicate these spells, such as ***eyes of charming***, the beholder's charm rays, and the vampire's charm gaze also are subject to elven and half-elven resistance. Sleep-inducing breath weapons, such as the brass dragon's sleep gas, are not. Neither are the ***rod of beguiling*** or the ***rod of rulership***; charm effects from a ***staff of commanding*** are.`,
                `Spells and other effects that merely incapacitate the subjects or that allow only limited control, such as ***hold*** spells, ***hypnosis***, ***suggestion***, ***quest***, and ***geas*** are not subject the eleven or half-eleven resistance.

If a priest character spends the time and money to research an entirely new spell, no other priest should be able to get it unless the inventor teaches him the spell or he finds the spell on a scroll. Teaching another priest a new spell should take about a day per spell level. Learning a new priest spell from a scroll also should take a day per spell level and the process should consume the scroll (it goes blank when the priest finishes dissecting it). In either case, the priest learning the spell understands it automatically so long as he is of a level sufficient to cast the spell and the spell is included in a sphere the priest has access to.`,

What's to prevent a 7th-level transmuter from building two great wyrm dragons a day out of the local rat population? If ***polymorph other*** were cast on a rat to change it into a gold dragon, there would be more than a 200% chance that the rat would permanently become a dragon, complete with all the dragon's magical and special abilities. Aside from the system shock rolls, saving throws, and the ***dispel magic*** spell, there seems to be no limit on what a measly 7th-level wizard can do, and the spell is permanent!`,
            answer: [
                `It is true that ***dispel magic*** and system shock rolls are the only limits the rules place on the spell. Other limits come from the DM. It is also true that turning a creature with animal intelligence, such as a rat, into something as smart as a gold dragon makes the creature assuming the mind and abilities of its assumed form inevitable. The ***polymorph other*** spell, however, is not too powerful at all if the DM is clever.`,
                `First, there's nothing in the spell that says the caster gets to pick the transformed creature's age. That's for the DM to decide. You might want to apply the subject creature's age to the lifespan of the assumed form to determine the assumed form's maturity. In the case of a rat, the resulting dragon is always going to be a hatchling because rats just don't live that long. Or perhaps the subject's level of maturity translates directly into the assumed form's maturity. So if a caster wants a great wyrm dragon he has to find a really old and decrepit rat.`,
                `You could really have some fun with a greedy player of you choose the latter option. If the caster picks a young and healthy rat (with a reasonable chance to survive a system shock roll), he should get a hatchling gold dragon. Being young, the dragon is hungry. Being violently thrust into dragonhood, the dragon is shy and insecure. The dragon might follow the character around, eating the character's treasure (gold dragons eat gems), occasionally cutting loose with its breath weapon because it is scared (maybe it saw a cat), and making a general nuisance of itself. Imagine the scene if the dragon visits a jewelry shop for a snack. Being lawful good, the dragon surely will tell the irate jeweler and the town guard where "mom" is.`,
                `If the caster chooses a venerable old rat, the creature's system shock percentage should be very low (35% or less); let's face it, old rats aren't going to have really high Constitution scores. If the caster does manage to create a venerable, wyrm, or great wyrm gold dragon, the creature probably is going to take charge. Gold dragons are lawful good, but no creature with 22 or more hit dice is going to take orders from a measly 7th-level wizard. The dragon might help the character in some small way, but the character probably will find himself embarked on some series of adventures of the dragon's choosing before long. Woe to the character when an errant ***dispel magic*** spell ends the enchantment and the poor fool is left stranded somewhere with only a mangy rat for company.`,
                `Many spells in the game are prone to abuse, but only if the DM lets players get away with it. Greedy NPCs, of course, usually get their comeuppance out offstage. It might be amusing to stage an encounter with an enchanted gold dragon and its unwilling wizard servant as a cautionary tale to the players.`

The section on Intelligence in the ***Player's Handbook*** says the character notices some inconsistency in the illusion that automatically allows the character to make his saving throw.

                `If you follow the rules to the letter, creatures with Intelligence scores of 19 or higher automatically make successful saving throws against low-level illusions, as shown on Table 4 in the ***PHB***. If the illusion in question does not allow a saving throw, then the character is still affected. For example, a character with an Intelligence score of 20 is automatically unaffected by any illusion/phantasm spells of 1st or 2nd level, provided they allow saving throws. The character could ignore an ***improved phantasmal force*** spell, which allows a saving throw, but is affected normally by a ***mirror image*** spell, which does not allow a saving throw. When in doubt, check the spell description. If the saving throw entry at the beginning of the spell says "None" the spell has no saving throw. Note that for classic illusions such as ***phantasmal force***, ***improved phantasmal force***, ***spectral force***, and the like, a saving throw and disbelief are one in the same. That's why these spells have saving throws listed as "Special." Normally, characters have to do something (state disbelief) before they roll saving throws against these spells. Creatures with very high Intelligence scores get to disbelieve land save) automatically.`,

            question: `A little less than a year ago, my boyfriend introduced me to the AD&D game, and I enjoy it very much. I'm also pretty good at it, and the local players quickly dropped their reservations about having a newbie in the group and invited me into the campaign. I have several characters who have become important in the campaign, and I've kept a detailed journal of all my character's adventures. Not long ago, my boyfriend and I had a private (not game related) disagreement, and the gaming group decided to take his side. Now, I'm barred from the campaign, and the DM says I can't play my characters anywhere else. (One of my characters started out as an NPC that the DM gave me to play.) Someone in the group even walked into my house while I was away and took my characters and my dice. It was probably the DM; he often uses the game to get his own way. If a player doesn't do what he wants, the player's character gets killed in the next game. I'm really mad because the DM won't give my characters back. My boyfriend and I aren't playing anymore, but I still want my characters back. Can a DM tell a player not to use a character anymore? As a capable female player I used to be pretty hot commodity, but now I'm barred from the game. What should I do? The only thing I can think of now is to sock the DM in the gut until he gives me my stuff (and believe me, I have some friends who would be delighted to do just that). I just want to play AD&D.`,
            answer: [
                `The first thing you should do is step back and take a few deep breaths. If you're involved in a campaign where people carry grudges from real life into the game, and also take them back to real life again, it's high time you found a new campaign. If you can walk away from it after losing only a few characters and a bag of dice, you should feel lucky. Take a little time away from the game; judging from the full text of your letter (six pages), I'd say your gaming has put you under entirely too much emotional stress. Gaming is supposed to be *fun*.`,
                `To answer your rules question, no, there's nothing in the books that says DMs can tell their players what characters to use in other campaigns. If you've got a character you like—even a dead character—from an old campaign and you think it would be fun to play it somewhere else, go right ahead. You should explain to the new DM, however, that you've played the character before. Some DMs don't like to accept recycled characters.`,
                `As far as your future involvement in the campaign and any further attempts to get your property (dice and characters) back, here are my suggestions:`,
                `First, find another campaign to play in. There are literally millions of AD&D players out there, so your entire AD&D game experience does not depend on this one group. Better yet, start a campaign of your own. Stop being flattered that a group of veterans took you in and start showing a group of newbies how to play the game right—you've certainly got plenty of experience with a game that is played wrong. Your journal should give you plenty of ideas for a campaign of your own.`,
                `Second, give up on the NPC you adopted. It's churlish of the DM who gave you the character to ask you not to play it anymore, but the character is not worth the struggle, no matter how much you love it. If you're as good at the game as you say you are, you'll have no trouble creating another great character on your own. Besides, if the DM is on a power trip you'll deny him the satisfaction he gets from withholding the character from you. If you're really fond of the character, create a new character based on the one you lost. Perhaps the new character is the original character's twin, who has gone out adventuring to find out why the original character mysteriously disappeared.`,
                `Third, either take legal action to get your stolen property back or let it go. Do not under any circumstance "sock" the DM in the gut or send your friends to snatch your property back. If your former gaming comrades took your property without your permission they're guilty of theft, pure and simple. That is a matter for the police, not for you or for your friends. On the other hand, you can always create new characters and buy new dice. Doing so probably will take less time, effort and anguish than wresting with the legal system, especially since your case probably isn't going to enjoy a very high priority with the local police and district attorney. It's up to you.`

A ***wand of chain lightning*** could only produce a bolt of lighting with a maximum damage rating of 6d6 and a maximum range of 70 yards. It makes no difference that ***chain lighting*** requires a 12th-level caster; the best the wand can do is 6d6 points of damage.

Rather than hacking the thing to bits and hauling away the pieces, the party cleric cast a ***frisky chest*** spell on the statue. The rest of the party lined up at strategic positions along the route back to the entrance and herded the statue all the way outside, where they had a chariot waiting. Is this feat really possible, I did I give my players an undeserved gift?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***frisky chest*** spell can affect any object small enough to fit inside a 10' cube. If the statue wasn't too big, you and your players did things according to the rules.`,
                `Now, ***frisky chest*** is a spell designed to help priests protect their stuff, it's not for extracting treasure from dungeons. So, your players were abusing the spell and you might indeed have given them and undeserved gift. Because ***frisky chest*** is suppose to foil thieves, the statue's movements should have been contrary to what the players wanted at every possible opportunity. Now consider how much noise a walking statue might make. Were there any denizens of the dungeon within earshot? A surprise attack by a group of monsters might have really wrecked the party's day, especially if they were separated and concentrating on the statue when the attack came. Also think about how much the statue weighed. Could the chariot hold all that weight when the party finally herded the statue aboard? Could the dungeon floor hold the statue as the it ambled along? Note that the spell allows the animated object to sprout whatever appendages are most appropriate. Did the statue sprout wings and fly away when the PCs finally got it outside? Note also that any restraint place on the object breaks a ***frisky chest*** spell. So, the party might have caught the statue as it flew away, but the minute they got hold of it they would have been holding dead weight. That might be inconvenient if anyone was standing under it at the time.`,

Divination spells such as ***identify***, ***commune***, ***contact other plane***, and ***legend lore*** can reveal or at least hint at specific powers. Otherwise, characters just have to experiment with newly acquired items and try to puzzle them out. Even a small sip of a potion for example, produces a minor effect that hints at the potion's enchantment. A sip of a growth potion, for instance, might make a character's clothing or armor feel tight. Items that produce continual effects are fairly easy to test. A character who has just donned a ***ring of water walking***, for example, will have a pretty good idea what he has after a trip to the local pond or fountain.`,
                `Items with specific triggers or command words are trickier. Usually, the owner will have to visit the local sage, bard, or high-level spellcaster to get some clue about how to start experimenting with the item. Some DMs devise intricate puzzles their players must solve before their characters can use their items. It all depends on how rare and wonderful the DM wants to make magic. If players have to work hard for their magic they tend to appreciate it more.`,
                `Note that intelligent items such as swords might be able to tell their owners what their powers are (though they don't always do so). Also, nothing beats instructions from the previous owner when trying to figure out a magical item's properties. Taking a few prisoners and negotiating with them carefully can be well worth the effort.`

            answer: [

If the creature pushes hard against the circle, can it make the paladin move? What happens when the paladin gets forced into an obstacle?`,
            answer: [
                `You're confusing the aura of protection that surrounds a paladin with a ***protection from evil*** spell. In the AD&D 2nd Edition game, the two are similar, but not the same. A paladin's aura of protection doesn't hedge out anything. Evil, conjured, or enchanted creatures within 10' of the paladin suffer a -1 attack penalty, but the aura doesn't keep them out. The aura, like a ***protection from evil*** spell, also prevents any form magical control from being exerted across the barrier.`,
                `Note that it is not possible to exert force across the barrier formed by ***protection from evil*** or a ***protection from evil 10' radius*** spell. Neither version of the spell creates a giant hamster ball like an ***Ottiluke's resilient sphere*** does. If a creature that normally would be hedged out by the spell, nothing happens if it pushes against the barrier. The creature cannot cross the barrier, but it also cannot make the character at the center of the spell move, not even by a micron. On the other hand, if a character protected by the spell forces the barrier against a creature that normally would be hedged out, the barrier collapses, ending the spell.`

Page 32 of the ***PLAYER'S OPTION™: Combat & Tactics*** book says large monsters bump the weapon's knockdown die up to the next size. Does this mean that a centaur with a two-handed sword rolls 1d20 for knockdowns? If the centaur also is a grand master with a two-handed sword does he roll 1d1OO for knockdowns?`,
            answer: [
                `A knockdown die of 1d12 increases to 1d20. I don't recommend allowing any knockdown die to increase beyond 1d20. (As it is, rolling 1d20 will give a knockdown chance about half the time against huge opponents and even more often against smaller opponents.) I also don't recommend increasing any knockdown die more than three places. For example, a creature armed with a dagger never gets a knockdown die bigger than 1d10, no matter how big or skilled it is.`,
                `If you don't like the foregoing advice, the steps beyond 1d20 are: 1d30, 1d40, 1d50, and so on. The best way to generate these numbers is with 1d10 and some kind of a control die. For example, you can roll 1d30 by rolling a 10-sided die and a six-sided die. If the six-sided die comes up a 1 or 2, read the lo-sided die as it is. If the six-sided die rolls a 3 or 4, add 10 to the number on the 10-sided die, and if the six-sided die comes up a 5 or 6 add 20 to the number on the 10-sided die.`

Page 67, however, says defilers cause destruction when they memorize their spells. Which is correct? If the latter is true, how should DMs of ongoing campaigns explain the change?`,
            answer: [
                `The text on page 67 is correct. Note that in addition to causing damage when memorizing spells, defilers also must make Intelligence checks to see how successful they are (see Table XVII on page 28) in acquiring the spells. Defiling is no longer a sure thing.`,
                `How you should implement the new defiling rules into an established campaign is a problem you must solve on your own. The simplest way is to ignore them and stick with the old rules. For most campaigns, you can just announce that reality has changed and that things will be different from now on. To add a little mystery, you might want to explain that no one, not even the PCs, remembers any other kind of defiling. If you're feeling a bit cruel, you might rule that the PCs remember the old way of doing things, but no one else does.`,
                `If you favor a more dramatic approach, you can introduce some spectacular or cataclysmic event (the appearance of a hitherto unknown comet would do nicely) that causes the change. In either case, you might introduce the change gradually. For example, perhaps defilers only have to make Intelligence checks when memorizing spells after sunrise, and the defiling effect of memorization might be minimal, a radius of inches. Over the next few weeks or months, gradually increase both the radius of the defiling effect and decrease the number of hours in a day that the effect can be avoided. You might even want to design a series of adventures that would allow your PCs to prevent the change — if they want to.`

            answer: [
                `The *missile* or *missiles* from the ***magic missile*** spell in your example would strike the fighter, because the fighter is the spell's target.

The missiles might streak directly toward the fighter and turn abruptly to avoid the thief, or they might curve so gradually that nobody notices.

This situation is similar to what would happen if the thief jostled a piece of furniture or a curtain. If the DM decides the *missiles'* erratic course could betray the thief's presence, any observers should attempt saving throws vs. spells.

The ***Player's Handbook***, however, says that anyone with both human and elven ancestors is either a human or a half-elf (see ***PHB***, page 30).

            answer: [
                `Charging is a full-move action, but it's included on the half-move list for two reasons. First, it is possible that a charging character might enter melee range with the enemy during the first half of his movement. In such a case, the character stops moving and makes his attack; once he stops to attack, his movement is over (though he still can make the standard one-square adjustment after the attack). Second, its okay to let a character who already has made a half move to charge during the second half of his movement. Players often wish their characters to make delayed charges in response to unexpected moves from the enemy, when their comrades suffer knockdowns, and in many other situations. A character making a "half charge" is subject to all the bonuses and penalties associated with charging (see ***Combat & Tactics***, page 25).`,

If a one-slot proficiency allows add-ons (such as the ancient languages proficiency, which allows the character to learn additional languages for a minimal character-point cost) or is something particularly difficult to learn (such as mountaineering or tracking), it should cost four character points. Fairly common or simple one-slot proficiencies should cost only two character points. Two-slot proficiencies should cost five character points.`,

            question: `How many spellbook pages are required to include the reversed form of a spell?`,
            answer: [
                `It depends on the spell. Reversible spells, such as ***knock***, ***locate object***, and ***stone to flesh*** require no extra spellbook space at all. A single spell entry does double duty, though the wizard still must decide which version he will memorize when studying spells for the day. Separate spells that are essentially reversed versions of each other, such as ***haste*** and ***slow***, must be recorded separately. In either case, a single spell requires a number of spellbook pages equal to the spell's level plus 0-5 (1d6-1) pages (see ***PHB***, page 63).`,

            question: `If a specialist wizard uses a magical item from an opposition school, such as a transmuter using an ***amulet of proof against detection and location*** (abjuration magic) what happens? Can the transmuter use this device at all? Is there a penalty?`,
            answer: [
                `As "Sage Advice" has suggested before, specialist wizards should be free to use all magical items that can be used by any character class, even when they involve magic from their opposition schools. The specialist wizard magical item limitations are intended to apply solely to wizard-only items.`,

            question: `How many years does a character age per level of experience gained? I hardly think that a truly seasoned warrior (20th level or higher) would be only 25 to 30 years old. After all, the true greats, such as the wizard Elminster are depicted as elderly.`,
            answer: [
                `The first step in determining any character's age is to generate a starting age from Table 11 in the ***PHB***. Now, divide that value by the absolute maximum age for the character's race (also determined from Table 11). Multiply the quotient by the character's actual maximum age (again from Table 11). This is the character's “geezer factor.” If person playing the character is past middle age himself, double the geezer factor (everyone knows time passes faster for older people). If the person playing the character is a game advice columnist who has begun to ponder just how many people there are out there who just have to have a rule for everything, triple the geezer factor (because thoughts of this kind will make you old in a real hurry). In any case, for every 50,000 experience points the character earns he ages one geezer factor.`,
                `There you go, simple. Go try the formula on a couple of sample characters to see how it works. I'll wait....`,
                `Have you done that? I hope not, because the Sage was just pulling your leg.`,
                `How about this as an alternate method: Determine the character's starting age (Table 11 again), and then figure out how much time has gone by in the campaign since the character started play. (Pretty clever, huh? That's why I get the big bucks.) If you need help with campaign time, check out Chapter 14 in the ***Player's Handbook*** and Chapter 14 in the ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide***. Of course, if you asked your question because you're creating a new character at level 20 or higher, just make him whatever age you want him to be. If you think 25 to 30 years old is too young, you're probably right. To set the character's age, start by thinking about how much game time it might take to gain 20 or more levels (if you haven't any idea, you probably shouldn't be creating characters of that level). Now consider any notable events from the character's past (you weren't really going to create a brand-new character of level 20+ without giving him a history were you?). For example, if a 20th-level warrior's claim to fame was that he lead the imperial army to victory 50 years ago, he's almost certainly going to be considerably more than 50 years old; after all, babes in diapers usually don't command imperial armies, but then again anything's possible in a fantasy game and there's always the chance the character has been subjected to some kind of magical age adjustment.`,
                `In short, there is no hard-and-fast rule governing how fast characters age once they start play, its all a matter of judgment (and perhaps a little bookkeeping) on the part of the Player and the DM.`
