                `A dragon remains subdued indefinitely, as long as the subduing party clearly has the upper hand. An unintelligent dragon whose alignment is not diametrically opposed to its captor's alignment and which is weaker than its captor is unlikely to attempt escape as long as it is treated well (given its own treasure hoard, fed well, disciplined firmly and frequently, and allowed a small measure of freedom). Intelligent, spell-using dragons are disloyal even if relatively weak and dangerous if they believe they are as strong or stronger than their captors. Such a dragon spends every moment scheming to escape or to slay its captor and usurp his holdings.`

The tarrasque's attacks are listed as 1-12/1-2/2-24/5-50/1-10/10; isn't the 1-2 attack a bit weak for this monster?

            answer: [

                `Psionic strength is determined when a character is created. A character has a maximum of one attack and one defense point per point of psionic strength. Psionic strength is a constant, representing the character's maximum psychic potential and his relative power in psionic combat; it is never reduced except through the reduction of ability scores or similar mishaps. Attack and defense points represent the finite amount of psychic energy available to the character at any given time. Note that the use of psionic abilities require both attack and defense points (see the ***Players Handbook***, page 111).

What constitutes a transportable medium? Do magical items have to be retained and used before experience is awarded for them?`,
            answer: [
                `Gems and jewels don't have to be sold, but the experience value of these items is equal to their sale value in gold pieces. The ***DMG*** says treasure must be removed from the dungeon and converted into a transportable medium (i.e., carried on the character's person) or stored in a character's stronghold (residence). That is, treasure must be taken to a safe place, appraised, and assigned to PCs before any experience is awarded for it. A transportable medium can be anything the PC finds convenient. Likewise, experience is awarded for items that are added to a character's hoard, use notwithstanding. No experience is awarded for an item sold for cash or traded for goods or services.`

                `A composite bow is made up of layers or wood, bone, and sinew (this is the "composite"). They are more difficult to make than a one-piece bow (often called a self bow), hence the greater cost. Composite bows offer two advantages over self bows: They are more powerful for their size; a long self bow is longer than a man is tall; a long composite bow has about the same range but is only about 4' long. Composite bows can be specially built to allow for strength bonuses. One local campaign figures the cost of such special bows as equal to the base cost for the bow plus an equal amount per bonus point of damage, so that a bow allowing + 1 hp damage for a 16 or 17 strength is twice normal cost, a bow allowing +2 hp damage (18 strength) is triple the cost, etc.`

            answer: [
                `The spells do always hit, after a fashion. In the case of a ***fireball***, the missile bursts at the designated range unless it strikes an object before it gets there. Since the missile flies in a straight line between the caster and the target, it can be blocked by invisible barriers (such as ***walls of force***) or by a bend in a passage obscured by an illusion or mirror.`,
                `A ***lightning bolt*** is similar to a ***fireball*** in that the spell begins at a designated height and range, extending directly away from the caster. A ***lightning bolt*** is always either 40' or 80' long, and the caster must decide which when he casts the spell. If caster miscalculates and casts this spell into an area too small to contain it, the lightning bolt grows to its full length (as measured from the point where it strikes a barrier), heading back at the caster unless it smashes through the barrier (see page 151). Some readers have misread the example on page 151; ***lightning bolts*** do not bend or fold over when hitting a barrier. The 80' bolt in the example starts 40' away from the caster, travels 10', and strikes a barrier; the bolt must maintain its full length, however, so the opposite end of the bolt (starting from the point of origin) instantly grows out in the direction toward the spell-caster, extending 70' from its point of origin. Thus, the bolt's final length is SO'. A victim caught between the point of origin and the wall behind him is not struck twice by the bolt. The use of the word rebound in the spell's description seems to be the confusing element.`

It takes two hands and 6' of clear space to throw a net, and the effective range is 30'. Any target hit by the net must save vs. breath weapon or become entangled. Entangled victims cannot fight or move, and defend at -2. Entangled victims wriggle free if they make a successful wrestling attack vs. AC 2; they can make one attempt to get free each round. When used as a melee weapon, treat a net as a scourge. A lasso is simply a rope with an adjustable loop. A successful hit with a lasso puts the loop around part of the target creature's body, but this does not necessarily immobilize the creature; the DM has to decide where the loop is (around the neck, a limb, the upper body, etc.) and assess the appropriate penalty. Since the lasso's wielder can pull the loop tight, the only way to escape, short of killing the wielder or getting the rope away from him, is to cut or break the rope.`

            question: `What is the proper way to handle a fight with a hydra? Does the creature's effective hit dice drop as it loses heads? Will damage to the creature's body kill it? How do area-effect spells such as ***fireball*** effect the heads? How does one determine when a lernaean hydra's regeneration ability is stopped?`,
            answer: [
                `Hydras do pose a few problems, especially when magic is involved. I suggest the following rules for handling combat with a hydra.`,
                `A hydra's effective hit dice do not drop as the creature loses heads. With respect to melee, each of a hydra's heads is treated as a separate creature. Each head dies when it reaches zero hit points, and excess damage does not carry over to another head. When all heads are reduced to zero hit points, the creature dies immediately. Hits to a hydra's body will kill it; the body has as many hit points as the total hit points of its starting heads. When the body is reduced to zero hit points, however, the creature continues to fight as long as it has at least one living head. It will then fight for an additional 2-8 rounds or until the body is reduced to -20 hp.`,
                `A lernaean hydra's regeneration ability makes it a tougher nut to crack. The individual heads can be slain in the normal manner; however, a fire source must be applied to each slain head or it will regenerate. ***Burning hands*** is the easiest way to scorch the stumps or sundered heads. A torch, flask of oil,. or ***flame tongue*** sword will stop a single head's regeneration if applied in time. Any successful hit on the slain head will stop regeneration. A lernaean hydra stays alive as long as it has one living or regenerating head (hits to the creature's body not withstanding).`,
                `When any hydra is affected by an area spell such as ***fireball*** or ***lightning bolt***, the heads are treated as a single entities, with the damage distributed as evenly as possible among the heads. Although the heads are separate melee targets, they are still part of the same creature. The creature's body suffers as much damage as the heads took in total (i.e., the hydra gets one saving throw, but the heads and the body each take damage).`,
                `Spells that can kill a creature outright such as ***death spell***, ***power word kill***, or ***disintegrate*** kill the creature only if it fails its saving throw (if applicable). When determining a hydra's resistance to such spells, its effective hit dice are equal to its starting number of heads (or peak number, in the case of a lernaean hydra), and its effective hit points are equal to the total hit points of all the heads (damage to the body notwithstanding).`,
                `A spell that affects one creature or a limited area (such as ***magic missile*** or ***burning hands***) must be directed either at the body or at one or more heads of the hydra, according to the limitations of the spell. Spells such as ***charm monster***, ***hold monster***; or ***slow*** affect the entire creature, as the beast effectively has only one brain—perhaps at the base of the necks inside the body.`

                `Weapon speed factors allow for comparison among weapons. The lower the speed factor, the quicker the weapon. Their most common use (and the only use mentioned in the rules) is for breaking ties on initiative. When a tie occurs, compare weapon speed factors; the lowest factor goes first. However, on the first round of a melee, when the opponents are closing, the longer weapons have the advantage. The advantage is also with mounted opponents attacking or defending against unmounted opponents and with characters who are defending or attacking from above. Spellcasting time is equivalent to the weapon speed factor. That is, a weapon with a speed factor of 3 is as slow as a three-segment spell for purposes of tie breaking.`

            answer: [
                `The tables list the bonus or penalty given to a weapon against the basic armor types. For example, the line for Axe, Hand reads: -5, -4, -3, etc., for AC 0, AC 1, AC 2, etc., respectively. Full plate armor and shield gives AC 0, so a hand axe has a -5 to hit vs. full plate armor and shield. If the target were wearing full plate armor + 1 and using no shield, the adjustment is still AC 0. However, full plate armor alone is AC 1, so you use the AC 1 column regardless of magical bonuses, and the hand axe has a -4 to hit. The same holds true for dexterity bonuses. These tables are for attacking humans, demi-humans, and humanoids—never for attacking monsters. Use of the tables is strictly optional; they were included in the game mainly to satisfy the real history buffs who know that certain weapons were much more effective than others on the medieval battlefield.`

            answer: [
                `You were correct. Pole arms are not intended to be thrown, no matter what the thrower's strength. Anything, however, can be thrown with some chance of success. For throwing a pole arm, we suggest a to-hit penalty of -4 at short range (10' or less), -6 at medium range (11-20'), and -9 at long range (21-30'). We also suggest that you use these ranges outdoors where other missiles have ranges measured in yards. A pole arm is far too long for a human-sized creature to throw like a hand axe (so that the weapon spins or tumbles), no matter how much strength is available. Spear-type throws are possible, but hits can inflict damage only if the pole arm that is thrown has a spear point. Use spear damage (1-6) in this case, not pole-arm damage.`

            answer: [
                `In medical terms, paralyzation is the loss of sensation in part of the body as the victim's brain, for one reason or another, no longer controls the body. The uncontrolled muscles relax, and the victim goes limp. Autonomic muscles, such as the heart and lungs, are unaffected. Some kinds of paralysis in the AD&D game (paralysis caused by ghouls and ghasts, for example) cause the victim to become rigid and immobile. In either case, paralysis affects only the body, not the mind. The victim can still think and use psionics or any form of movement that does not require muscular effort. For example, if a character becomes paralyzed while using a ***fly*** spell, he can still fly until the spell runs out.`,
                `Paralyzation is not permanent. It can last anywhere from several rounds or turns to as much as a day. It can be removed with a ***remove paralysis*** spell (which removes paralysis of all types) or by a ***cure disease***, ***neutralize poison***, or ***dispel magic*** spell, depending on what caused the paralysis. Paralysis caused by undead creatures is disease- or fear-based; paralysis caused by living creatures is poison-based; paralysis caused by a ***glyph of warding*** or the illusionist spell ***paralyzation*** is magic-based. The AD&D 2nd Edition ***Monstrous Compendium***, Volume 1, lists the duration for ghoul paralysis as 3-8 rounds and ghast paralysis as 5-10 rounds. Paralysis caused by more powerful creatures lasts longer; lich paralysis, for example, lasts until dispelled.`

            answer: [

                `The character firing the missile declares which creature he is targeting. (Any of the character's allies who are fighting with the target creatures are potential targets for the missile.) Randomly determine which target will actually be in the path of the missile. If the figures in the melee are about the same size (e.g., human vs. human, elf vs. dwarf), there is an equal chance that either the enemy or an ally could be the missile's actual target. If the die roll indicates that an ally will be the actual target and there are multiple allies fighting the intended target, randomly determine which ally is the actual target.`,
                `Roll the to-hit number. If the appropriate number for the target's armor class is rolled, then the target is hit whether or not the character firing the missile wanted to hit that target. If the creatures in the melee are of different sizes, the larger creatures are more likely to be hit. I suggest a two-thirds chance (1-4 on 1d6) to hit the larger target when the height difference is 2-3' (ignore height differences of less than 2'). If the height difference is more than 3', allow the missile to hit the larger target automatically if the firer wishes; otherwise, the chance to hit the larger target is 5 in 6.`,

A first rank character, for example, probably comes from a well-to-do family with clear connections to the imperial family, or perhaps the character belongs to the imperial family (he might be a distant cousin). Upper-class families are skilled artisans, scribes, or wealthy merchants.`

                `A battle axe is not a two-handed weapon. It is true that battle axes were often used with two hands, but this was because a man without a shield did not have anything better to do with his free hand and the axe's long haft provided space for the additional grip. If you want to experiment with statistics for two-handed use, improve the speed factor and AC adjustment for all armor types by + 1 and increase the damage inflicted to 3-9 (2d4 + 1).

            question: `How do you determine the effect of a ***sleep*** spell on a group of mixed creature types?`,
            answer: [
                `This is up to the DM. He may rule that weaker creatures are affected first, or he may allow the caster to choose whether the more powerful creatures or the weaker creatures are affected first. He may also rule that creatures closest to the center of the spell's area of effect are affected first. The DM can choose any of these methods as long as he uses the same method all of the time.`,
                `If weaker creatures are affected first, the DM should roll to see how many of them are put to sleep and apply the effects. If all of the weaker creatures were put to sleep by the spell, and if the number of potential victims rolled was greater than the number actually affected, the DM may then take half of that difference (dropping fractions) and apply that to the next most powerful group of victims. For example, a magic-user faces a group of six 1—1-HD creatures, two 1-HD creatures, and one 3-HD creature. The DM rolls 4d4 and gets a 10. The six 1—1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving a difference of 4. Half of 4 is two, so the two 1-HD creatures fall asleep, leaving the 3-HD creature unaffected., In another example, the magic-user faces four 1-HD creatures and one 4 + 1-HD creature. The DM rolls 2d4 and gets a 5. Four 1-HD creatures fall asleep; the difference is 1, but nothing remains after 1 is reduced by half and all fractions are dropped. Even if the result of the 2d4 roll had been an 8, the 4 + 1-HD creature would not be affected (8 - 4 = 4, 1⁄2 x 4 = 2, but no monsters were present in the 2 + 1 to 3-HD category). The PC should not have everything his own way!`

            question: `How does an ***anti-magic shell*** work? Does it destroy any spell with which it comes in contact? Can the caster cast spells through the ***anti-magic shell***?`,
            answer: [
                `An ***anti-magic shell*** negates all magic within its area of effect. The caster's spells (which originate within the shell) are also negated, although they may remain after the shell's duration expires if their own durations are long enough. Note also that the shell causes magical items within its area of effect to cease functioning. In any case, the shell does not function like a ***dispel magic*** spell. Magical items are not destroyed by the shell; they merely cease to function while within it. If their duration permits, magical effects will still function when they are taken away from the shell or when the shell's duration expires. For example, a ***continual light*** spell cast upon a rock will be negated only as long as that rock is within the shell; the ***continual light*** spell functions normally afterward. If part of a magical effect's area extends into the shell, only the portion within the shell is negated; the effect functions normally outside the shell. However, if a spell with an instantaneous duration is cast so that its center is within the radius of the shell, the spell is *completely* negated. For example, if a ***fireball*** were cast so that it would detonate inside an ***anti-magic shell***, there would be no effect. If a ***fireball*** were cast so that it would detonate outside the ***shell***, however, only the portion of the ***fireball*** crossing into the shell would be negated.`

When the magic-user reaches 2nd level, he can cast two first-level spells, and he gains an additional first-level spell for his book.

In fact, society is the source of creativity and enjoyment—gamers, game producers, and game columnists are part of society. Society as a whole is not down on gamers; some people I know who make it a hobby to study the anti-role-playing movement tell me the whole brouhaha is the work of less than a dozen people, most of them in the United States, who were well known for their questionable religious dogmas long before the D&D® and AD&D games came on the scene. No major religious sect or denomination officially opposes the D&D game or any other role-playing game. These few individuals have been able to fool a lot of people into believing their propaganda by pointing to a few items in the old AD&D game books and saying, "This is a satanic game."

            answer: [
                `A dragon's combat modifier applies only to its damage rolls; the reference to attack rolls is left over from an earlier version of the manuscript. From age category five on, one digit has been dropped from the black dragon's breath weapon rating; starting from age category one, the column should read: 2d4+1, 4d4+2, 6d4+3, 8d4+4, 10d4+5, 12d4+6, 14d4+7, 16d4+8, 18d4+9, 20d4+10, 22d4+11, and 24d4+12. The "MT" is a typo; it should read "MR" for magic resistance. Only a dragon's body length is considered when calculating a dragon's size rating, since the tail is very thin. Also, damage to a dragon's tail does not really harm the dragon; only hits on the body and wings are telling enough to reduce the dragon's hit points. This makes dragons a little less vulnerable to mob tactics. A great wyrm bronze dragon's tail is 100-110' long. In the core AD&D 2nd Edition rules, a dragon can use its breath weapon three times a day, once every three rounds. To make fighting dragons less of a certain thing, however, I suggest you make the interval between breath weapons variable (roll 1d3 for the number of interval rounds). An alternate method for determining the number of a dragon's breath weapons used each day is discussed in "The New Ecology of the Dragons," in DRAGON issue #146.`

Heucuva (the name is the same in singular and plural forms) appear to be common skeletons when viewed with infravision, no matter what guise they have adopted using ***polymorph***; a party using infravision will simply not be able to distinguish them from regular skeletons.

            answer: [
                `You seem to be confused by the difference between the number of spells a magic-user can have memorized at any given time and the number of spells that he can have written in his spell book.`,
                `The number of spells that any magic-user can have memorized at any one time is given on the Spells Usable By Class And Level chart in the ***PHB*** (page 26). To use the chart, find the level of the spell-caster (first column). The total number of spells his brain can hold is given to the right of his level. For example, the "Magic-users Spell Level" line for a 4th-level magic-user reads: 3 2. This means that a 4th-level magic-user can memorize up to three first-level spells and two second-level spells.`,
                `When a magic-user prepares for an adventure, he studies his books and commits spells to memory, up to his "full load." When he casts one of these spells, the memory of it goes away (as explained on page 40 of the ***PHB***), and he must memorize it again before he can cast it again. The number of spells a magic-user can have in his spell book is determined by his intelligence score.`,
                `There are two ways, however, that the magic-user could cast a spell without memorizing it first. The first is by using a scroll—a temporary magical writing. Any time after a magic-user has studied a scroll while using a ***read magic*** spell, he can read that scroll aloud and cast the spell written on it, whether or not he has that spell memorized. A spell written on a scroll can be cast once only; the writing disappears when the spell is cast. (See pages 100-101 of the 1st Edition ***PHB*** and pages 127-128 of the 1st Edition ***DMG*** for more information on the use of scrolls.) The second is to read the spell directly out of the spell book. This causes the spell to disappear from the book (so that the magic-user cannot memorize it again until he can write it into the book again) and may also cause other spells to disappear from the book (see page 80 of ***Unearthed Arcana*** for more details on casting spells directly from books).`

A zombie, however, is a creature (even if it is biologically dead). In the AD&D® 1st Edition rules, a mage who ***enlarged*** a corpse and cast ***permanency*** on it would have only a 5% chance to lose point of constitution (see the 1st Edition ***DMG***, page 46), because he was working with an object.

What would be the range if they were launched singly? Would the ranges for other draconians be similar?`,
            answer: [
                `**Catapulted draconians:** Light catapults hurl rocks that weigh 8-10 lbs. Heavy catapults hurl rocks that weigh 20-25 lbs. Even a single draconian of any species placed on a catapult would overload the machine so much that the catapult wouldn't fire at all. Trebuchets, however, have a much larger load capacity, hurling rocks that weigh about 500 lbs., which is probably about right for three draconians. Rocks, however, are a bit more aerodynamic than any three wingless draconians tied together, so a draconian-firing trebuchet's range should be halved, for a maximum range of 240 yards and a minimum of 120 yards.`,

                `**Wormy PC:** Characters retain their hit points and intellect when subjected to ***polymorphing***, so your character should have been the worlds smartest and toughest worm, at least until he failed an intelligence check and assumed a worm's mentality (if a worm can be said to have a mentality). Your character would be dead if chopped in half while still mentally a "person" If the character reverted to worm mentality before being cut in half, it still would be one tough worm (having your PC's hit points), but it might very well survive being chopped in half if anyone were persistent enough to actually do it. Many DMs, however, would rule that the ***polymorph*** spell could no longer be dispelled once the change in personality took place. If the magic on either or both halves of the worm were dispelled, you'd have one or two halves of a dead character.

                `**Legless gnome:** The character carrying the gnome is going to be encumbered, even if he can handle the weight, because of the gnome's bulk. This means he'll suffer at least a -1 penalty to his to-hit rolls (see the 2nd Edition ***Player's Handbook***, page 79); the penalty will be worse if the gnome weighs enough to reduce the carrier's movement.

            question: `If a ***bastard sword +6***, defender was trampled by a triceratops, and the roll on the item saving-throw table was a 1 on 1d20, would the item fail because the roll was a 1 or would it make the save because it needs a 6 to save and its pluses make up the difference? If the sword did break, could it be remade with all its pluses? Would a ***wish*** completely restore the broken sword?`,
            answer: [
                `**Dinosaur vs. magical item:** In either edition of the AD&D game, a roll of 1 always fails a saving throw, weapons' bonuses notwithstanding. Someone is bound to write to me and point out that the item saving-throw table in the 1st Edition ***DMG***, page 80, lists the numbers 1 and 0 in several places. When an item has a saving throw of 1, a roll of 1 still fails; however, if the DM assigns a circumstantial penalty, any adjusted roll of 1 or more is a successful save. For example, a book falling 15' onto a hard surface has a modifier of -2 (-1 for every 5' beyond the first 5'1; if a 3 were rolled as a save, the save would be successful (3 - 2 = 1, still good). Items that have a save of 0 are immune to the listed attack form; for example, liquids are immune to blows, even if their containers are not.`,
                `A ***wish*** certainly could restore the sword if all its pieces were present. Whether or not the sword could simply be remade is up to the DM. I suggest that most enchanted items be rendered nonmagical if broken, though I can think of one or two classic fantasy stories in which broken magical items were remade. If the item is very powerful (with a bonus of +4 or better), it might be remade if it is simply broken—not ***disintegrated*** or reduced to ash or slag—and if it rolls a second save of 20. The item should get a bonus of +1 for every two magical bonuses the item has (artifacts receive a +4 bonus to their saves). If the item fails the second save, it no longer radiates magic; characters smart enough to use ***detect magic*** will know an attempt to repair the item is a waste of time. If the save is successful, the repair should be made using the best possible materials and a master craftsman of unequaled skill; finding either of these should be an adventure in itself. If the DM really wants to prolong the player's agony, he can require the being who will repair the item to make a successful proficiency check and maybe even make a save vs. spells to be successful.`,

            question: `Can a ***simulacrum*** be healed with a ***cure light wounds*** spell? How would a spell such as ***enlarge*** affect a ***simulacrum***? Can a character detect a ***simulacrum*** just by talking to it awhile? How do spells like ***dispel magic*** and ***anti-magic shell*** affect ***simulacrums***? Since ***simulacrums*** are made of snow, are they especially susceptible to fire or heat?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***simulacrum***, once completed, is a creature—not an object—made of nonliving matter; it's a construct something like a golem. Most spells that affect creatures also affect ***simulacrums***. Spells like ***magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, haste***, and ***protection from normal missiles***, which affect only creatures, also work on ***simulacrums***. So do spells like ***charms*** and ***holds***, if the creature that the ***simulacrum*** duplicates can be affected by those spells.`,
                `A ***simulacrum*** is composed entirely of nonliving matter and is not truly alive. Consequently, curative spells do not work on ***simulacrums***, and repairing damage done to them is a difficult and costly process (see the ***PHB***, page 186). (In the AD&D 1st Edition game, a ***simulacrum*** could be ***enlarged*** or ***reduced*** at the lower, nonliving matter rate.) ***Simulacrums*** do not need to breathe or eat, through they usually do so to avoid detection.`,
                `Once completed, a ***simulacrum*** cannot be ***dispelled*** or rendered nonfunctional by a ***dispel magic*** spell. ***Anti-magic shells*** keep ***simulacrums*** and other magically created creatures at bay (see the ***PHB***, page 173), but ***protection from evil*** in any form does not. A ***Mordenkainen's disjunction*** spell can destroy ***simulacrums*** just as it can destroy magical items; the creature's chance to resist the ***disjunction*** is based on its creator's level (or on level 14, if the creator's level is unknown).`,
                `***Simulacrums*** usually cannot be detected by nonmagical means, since each one is a functioning replica of some creature; however, the replica's degree of accuracy is variable (see the ***PHB***, page 186), and the DM might give players subtle clues as to the creature's actual nature. Very poor ***simulacrums*** (having less than 55% of the original's hit points and knowledge) probably shy away from flame or intense heat, and they might speak in monotones. Characters who are quite familiar with the original creature should have no problem finding gaps in the ***simulacrum's*** knowledge, as even the best ***simulacrum*** has only 65% of the copied creature's knowledge and personality, but all such clues to the creature's true nature should be provided through role-playing. For example, a ***simulacrum*** of a character might lack the original's zest for apple cider, lack an unusual nonweapon proficiency, and lack the original's distaste for undercooked meat. Only very perceptive players should be able to detect a ***simulacrum*** in this manner.`,

            answer: [
                `Unless there is some outside force preventing it (see the ***PHB***, page 172), a character can ***teleport*** from anywhere. Particularly strict DMs might rule that any momentum the ***teleporting*** character has will carry over after the ***teleport*** is complete. For example, if a wizard ***teleports*** out of a runaway mine car, he still might be in for a whopping impact at his destination. Unless the DM decides that the magic needed to keep a cloud castle aloft blocks ***teleportation***, it is possible to ***teleport*** to that castle. Motion is not a factor in determining what constitutes a viable destination for a teleport spell. In a sun-centered solar system, every piece of a planet's surface constantly undergoes complex motions as the planet rotates, revolves around its star, and hurtles through space with the rest of the system (not to mention any tectonic motions in the planet's crust). Nevertheless, one can ***teleport*** to any place on the planet. The key word is "place." A piece of ground, an asteroid, and a castle are all places and thus can be the destinations of a ***teleport*** spell even if they are in motion. Any other place that can provide a substantial surface as required in the spell description will also serve. Stability goes hand in hand with substance in this case; a constantly changing surface such as a flowing stream, patch of quicksand, or heaving ship's deck cannot be a destination for a ***teleport*** spell. Note that carts, wagons, ships, and other conveyances are objects, not "places." A character can ***teleport*** from such locations, but not to them.`,

If young giants are treated as adult members of other races, shouldn't you use those races' experience values? Just how tall are young giants?`,
            answer: [
                `Those mysterious experience-point values are part of an aborted attempt to do just what you suggest—extrapolate juvenile abilities from adult abilities. However, this was dropped during the editing process to keep things simple and to keep the revised giants more compatible with the ones in the AD&D 1st Edition game. The juvenile experience-point values were printed in error and should be ignored; use the experience values from the appropriate race when making experience awards for juvenile giants.`,
                `If you want to derive young giants' abilities from adult members of the race, here's the discarded system: To determine an immature giant's age randomly, roll 1d4 A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat abilities and -4 hit points per die (minimum 1 hp/HD). Other rolls indicate juveniles with penalties to hit points, attack rolls, and damage done equal to the die roll. Juveniles in the -3 category also do one less die of damage per blow. For example, a -1 hill giant juvenile would have -1 hp/HD (with a minimum of 1 hp/HD) and a THAC0 of 10, and would do 1d6 - 1 hp damage with its fists or 2d6 + 6 with a club. A -3 hill giant has -3 hp/HD, a THAC0 of 12, does 1d6 -3 hp damage with its fist or 1d6 +4 with a club. Juveniles can hurl rocks; their minimum range is the same as an adult's, and the maximum range is equal to the adult maximum minus a value equal to 10 yards times the juvenile's combat penalty; the combat penalty also is subtracted from each die of damage that the rock does (minimum of 1 hp/damage die). For example, a -1 juvenile hill giant can hurl a rock from three to 190 yards for 2d8 - 2 hp damage.`,

Juveniles are anywhere from one-quarter adult height to full adult height; a -3 juvenile would be from one-quarter to one-half adult height, a -2 juvenile would be from one-half to three-quarters adult height, and so on.`,

Overall, demihumans are not nearly so versatile or adaptable as are humans, because all have special skills and limitations derived from their heredity and culture that simply close some doors to them when they seek professions. Game balance requires that each race in the game be equally playable. If demihumans—with their infravision, special resistances, and special abilities—could freely choose from every character class in the game, there wouldn't be much reason to play a human character.

Spells that create something out of virtually nothing or that release raw power fall into this category. Generally, "invocation" implies that the effect comes as the result of a petition to a greater power, while "evocation" implies the effect was compelled. This is why most clerical invocation/evocations are listed as invocations. The fact that the order of the Red Robes calls its invocation/evocation spells "invocations" could give a clue to its basic approach to magic, or it could be just a clever use of names.`,

Thus characters have to do a little backstepping when they reach first level. The experience penalties ***are*** cumulative, but optional. A character can drop a skill and avoid the experience penalty at any time. In the case of penalties totalling more than 100%, the character ***must*** abandon skills until the penalties total 100% or less. DMs are free to set their own standards for skill practice. I suggest the characters practice their skills during nonadventuring time according to the rules on page 119.

If a character successfully uses a skill one or more times during an adventure, extend his knowledge one month.`,

When overlapping the maps, I suggest putting the ***Kara-Tur*** map on top, as the mountains east of Solon really are there. Individual DMs will have to decide where the Dust Desert really ends—the edges would vary with the annual weather anyhow.

For example, any large and prosperous shipwrights' guild would have a library with volumes on ship design and construction, carpentry, forestry, logging, blacksmithing, rope making, weaving, sewing, and a host of other subjects, both practical and esoteric, related to shipbuilding. Members would use the library as a resource for training new members and for answering difficult or unforeseen questions that might come up during day-to-day business. The guild also would jealously guard its library to prevent competitors in other cities from learning its professional secrets and to prevent those people who are not guild members—like adventurers—from learning how to build their own ships and putting dues-paying guild members out of work. Though literacy is more common in the Realms than it was in the historical medieval world, the people of the Realms understand that knowledge is power and they do not share it readily.`,

            question: `I could not believe my eyes when I read your answer to the question about the cost of chain mail in issue #158. I, too, thought the prices had been misprinted. Your response that scale mail costs more to make than chain mail is idiotic and grossly unhistorical. Chain mail is made of wire (itself difficult and expensive to make) that is formed into links that are interlocked, then soldered or welded together. In the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., a Roman armorer, using techniques that remained essentially unchanged throughout the Middle Ages, could make four or five suits of chain mail a year. By contrast, scale mail uses metal plates—not wire—that are simply sewn onto a leather shirt.`,
            answer: [
                `To reiterate, the base cost of chain mail in the AD&D 2nd Edition game is 75 gp, and the base cost of scale mail is 120 gp. Itemized breakdowns of the costs of manufacture for each type of armor are given on page 6 of the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***. Your estimate of the construction time for chain mail agrees with the table in the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***, where an unsupervised apprentice working in a properly equipped shop can make a suit of chain mail in 10 weeks (5.2 suits a year). However, *two* apprentices working under the same conditions take eight weeks to make a suit of scale mail (16 man-weeks in all). Scale mail requires more raw materials (60 gp worth) than does chain mail (38 gp worth); chain mail's rings require less labor and metal than scale mail's plates.`,
                `Note, however, that chain mail and scale mail come from two different historical periods. (See the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 35, for a discussion of time periods in the AD&D game and their associated technology.) Scale mail, an ancient armor type, had all but disappeared by the time chain mail came into common use during the Middle Ages. Obviously, if you have a campaign set right on the borderline between the end of the Ancient period (when the ***DMG*** says chain mail doesn't exist at all) and the beginnings of the Dark Ages, about 1100 A.D. or so, chain mail is going to be very expensive. There are several reasons for this. First, chain mail would represent the newest and best concept in body armor—keeping up with the latest developments is always costly. Second, the manufacturing techniques and advanced metallurgy that made chain mail economical to manufacture during the Middle Ages would not yet have been invented. Third, from a campaign standpoint, chain mail *should* be more expensive than scale mail; you can kiss your play balance goodbye if the best armor available isn't also the most costly. You are free to set your own cost for chain mail in such a setting, but I recommend at least double (150 gp) and triple (225 gp) normal prices would not be unreasonable. Furthermore, chain mail in this setting probably would be made of iron, not steel, as the equipment list in the ***Player's Handbook*** assumes. Such chain mail would weigh 50 lbs. instead of the listed 40 lbs., or 25% more (see ***DMG***, page 38).`,
                `Speaking of the "unhistorical": One does not have to have wire to make chain mail. The Romans used rings cut, punched, or drilled from sheets of metal. The Romans and ancient Chinese probably also had access to cast rings. Wire was pretty rare in medieval Europe, and most wire was gold, silver, or copper for use in jewelry and adornments. Medieval armorers almost certainly made their chain mail from rods that they forged themselves from ingots or bars; this is not as difficult as it sounds, especially when the armorer knew what he was doing and had his whole life to practice the skill. (Note that making a rod from a chunk of raw metal takes a lot less hammering than what would be required to make a flat plate out of the same piece of metal.) Furthermore, the chain mail currently preserved in museums and private collections is not soldered or welded, but riveted; in most cases, however, the rivets were hammered so carefully that the links *appear* to be welded. Finally, not all chain mail had its links fastened. Ancient armorers often simply linked the rings, as did their successors when they were in a hurry or wanted to cut costs. This generally made inferior armor, but Oriental armorers often made very good unriveted chain mail (as good as riveted mail) by using a superior alloy and by making each ring from two or three coils of rod.`,
                `For readers who are interested in learning more about the manufacture of chain mail and other types of armor, I recommend ***A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor***, by George Cameron Stone. The book is uncommon but is available at better used book stores and at large libraries.`,

Now that you know this, perhaps you'd reconsider your answer to the "watery ranger" question. Where I'm from, characters get wished into glasses of water all the time (the idea originated in a fanzine), and your suggestion that such characters can be killed simply by drinking them is tough on PCs.`,
            answer: [
                `First, if ***wishes*** are so common in your campaigns that they are used for anything "all the time," you've got too many ***wishes*** floating around; cut back. Note that a ***wish*** is the only magic in the core AD&D rules that can turn a character into a glass of water. ***Polymorph any object*** can turn organic matter into inorganic matter, but into only one kind of matter at a time; a successful spell could turn a character into a glass, or into water, but not both.`,
                `Second, ***wishes*** are *not* intended to be used as direct attacks on creatures. Such ***wishes*** fall into the grossly unfair category (see ***PHB***, page 197), and the DM should actively subvert the intent of such spells whenever they are used, even when they are used by NPCs. Thus, if an evil wizard ***wishes*** a PC "into a glass of water." a huge glass containing the PC and many gallons of water should appear; rest assured that at least one novel twist exists for each possible wording of this ***wish***.`,
                `Third, this ***wish*** should allow a saving throw, since it is being used as a high-powered ***polymorph any object*** spell.`,
                `Fourth, any ***polymorphed*** character retains his hit points. Drinking the character will cause harm just as surely as eating the character would, but if the character has 100 hp, drinking the character is going to be a long and difficult process. Water in a glass has no armor class (it just sits there), but the most damage a human can do by drinking is 1-2 hp per round. Note that big, nasty teeth have no real effect on water, but a large tongue does, so a dragon or cow might be able to "drink" 1-12 hp each round. Also, as TSR editor Jon Pickens points out, if a character is turned into a *glass* of water, a few of his hit points will be held in the glass (say 10-20% of the total), and the glass must be smashed before the character can be killed; this, too, is easier said than done if the victim has a lot of hit points.`,
                `Finally, although evaporation or spillage can "kill" the character, death won't be instantaneous. An evaporated character is effectively in gaseous form until his molecules are thoroughly dispersed in the atmosphere; a kind DM might rule that the gaseous state lasts indefinitely. Similarly, a watery character poured into the dirt and allowed to soak in can be considered melded into stone and not truly dead.`

A ***wish*** certainly is more powerful than the 4th-level ***polymorph other***. If the character was ***polymorphed*** back to his original gender, a system-shock roll would be required. A successful ***dispel magic*** would change the character back to the "wrong" gender and would require another system-shock roll.`,

If the ***polymorphed*** character entered an ***anti-magic shell***, he would be forced back into the "wrong" form, and this would require a system-shock roll. Upon leaving the ***anti-magic shell***, the character immediately would resume the "correct" form, and another system-shock roll would be in order.`,

            question: `How is each spell's school chosen? Also please explain how the various pairs of opposing schools of magic were chosen. What is the nature of the opposition? Why do illusionists have to contend with an extra opposition school?`,
            answer: [
                `Generally, spells are grouped into schools according to the types of effects they produce and, by extension, the type of power used to produce their effects. Abjuration blocks, dispels, or protects; alteration produces changes in its target; conjuration/summoning brings material from some other place; enchantment/charm grants its users or targets special abilities; greater divination reveals information; illusion/phantasm causes perceived changes that are not real; invocation/evocation creates matter or energy; and necromancy provides or removes the energy of life. See ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook*** for detailed explanations of each school.`,
                `No two schools of magic are mutually hostile due to their natures; opposition arises from how the spells are learned and used. Specialist wizards employ methods of study and mental discipline that enhance their abilities to use certain types of magic and erode their aptitudes for others. This is why generalists can freely use magic from opposing schools while specialists cannot. Specific pairs of opposed schools were selected according to common sense and game balance. For example, if invokers spend a lot of time learning how to bring things into being from nothing, they probably neglect to learn how to call things from one place to another. Illusionists, who spend their time trying to create believable unrealities, have a hard time casting magic that produces and channels real energies; there are three such schools: invocation/evocation, necromancy, and abjuration.`,

For example, a fighter/wizard would use his fighter level when calculating his personality score in a conflict with an egotistical magical weapon, but would use his wizard level to determine his chance to detect scrying. The DM should decide which method to use, then use it consistently. Dual-classed characters use the level of the class in which they are currently active. If the character has more experience in the previous class, he can use the higher level but must pay the experience penalty for reverting to that class (***PHB***, page 45).`,

            question: `I'm confused by the castle construction section of ***The Castle Guide***. When using smaller work forces (page 60), is the savings calculated once per project, or more often? The "Larger Work Forces" section on the same page suggests that the savings be calculated per week, but if that's the case a character could get a castle for free just by cutting the work force in half and waiting patiently through the increased construction time. Also, if a character is feeling frugal but still is in a hurry, what's to keep him from reducing the work force but keeping it above 75% of normal, thus gaining substantial savings and not extending construction time?`,
            answer: [
                `The savings from reduced work forces is calculated per week, so dropping one worker saves 520 gp each year. However, ***The Castle Guide*** editor Bill Connors says there is some dropped copy in the "Smaller Work Forces" section. The last sentence in the second paragraph should read: "No reduction below 50% in the work force or cost is possible." While a castle builder can reduce labor and administration costs, he can't get them for free and must still pay for materials. Smart castle builders will adjust their work forces to get some savings, but I can think of two ways to discourage this if the referee thinks the practice is getting out of hand. First, an accident or misfortune (such as a raid or marauding monster) might deplete a reduced work force even further and cause a construction delay. Second, morale in the reduced work force might deteriorate. Workers who believe they are being asked to do the impossible tend to be resentful. This might prompt the referee to recalculate the Production Modifier in mid-project and declare a "cost overrun" for the castle.`,

            answer: [
                `Magic resistance applies only to spells and spell-like powers that directly affect the magic-resistant creature. Consequential effects, such as collapsing masonry resulting from an earthquake spell, ignore magic resistance. Magic resistance applies to any effect created through the memorization and casting of a spell, and to spell-like effects from wands, staves, rods, rings, and miscellaneous magical items. It does *not* apply to breath weapons, gaze attacks, energy draining, psionic abilities, and similar special attack forms; nor does it apply to effects that are intrinsic to an item, such as the magical "pluses" on an enchanted weapon or piece of armor. There are many cases where effects fall into a gray area, and the DM must rule on these as they come up. When in doubt, treat any effect that behaves like a spell (i.e., that operates when the user does something special to create it—concentrates, expends a charge from an item, etc.) as a spell.`,
                `Magic resistance can work against ***protection from evil*** spells; see the section on "in place" spells in the ***DMG***, page 67, and in the ***PHB***, page 102. However, many DMs rule that ***protection from evil*** is a special case, especially in campaigns where ***protection from evil*** is the only readily available defense against magic-resistant creatures. This is perfectly acceptable, since the power of ***protection from evil*** can be considered a consequential effect of a spell. A paladin's ***protection from evil*** power probably should be considered a special ability not subject to magic resistance, but it could be treated as a permanent magical effect (also see the ***DMG***, page 67, and the ***PHB***, page 102).`,

The reference section of your local library should also help. Herbalism mainly is used to identify plants and fungi. A successful proficiency check might reveal a plant's most common names and whether or not it is edible, poisonous, or medicinal. A successful proficiency check might also allow the herbalist to know where a certain plant grows and to find it if any are growing nearby. The DM must decide how powerful an herbal concoction is. In normal circumstances, I suggest that the herbalist be limited to mild poisons and weak healing balms. Mild poisons include types A, G, K, and O (see the ***DMG***, page 73). Herbal healing balms might include poultices that heal 1 hp damage when applied to wounds, salves that allow a resting character to gain one extra hit point each day, and the like; characters with the healing proficiency might be able to use these products with greater effect, say to heal 1-4 hp damage or gain an extra 1-4 hp per day of rest. Of course, if the herbalist has access to extraordinary plants (such as those found in rain forests), he would be able to produce more potent concoctions.`,

What skills would he have? How many proficiency slots would he have to use? (I don't think the character should have to give up all his nonweapon proficiency slots after all that effort.) How would you simulate this skill in a game where the original AD&D game rules are used?`,
            answer: [
                `The DM should have been thinking about this while the PC was busy doing all his research. Since the game does not contain a poison-manufacturing proficiency *per se* (herbalism gives an incidental understanding of plant poisons, but many poisons are derived from animals or minerals), you'd have to create a new proficiency.`,
                `Such a proficiency might require two proficiency slots and be based on Intelligence -2. Depending on the campaign, this proficiency would fall under one or more of the following categories: wizard, priest, rogue. The character would have to expend at least two slots to get the skill; the time and effort the character is devoting to learning all about poisons is not going to be available for learning languages or other skills. However, you might allow the character to purchase extra slots for improving the proficiency once it has been bought, but only if the character has no other slots available and the proficiency score is not raised above 16. The proficiency might allow the character to do one or more of the following, at the DM's option: concoct any poison on the DMG's poison table (see previous question); create entirely new poisons; prepare poison antidotes; recognize the "poison potential" in any plant, animal, or mineral encountered; recognize a poison by its effect on a victim.`,
                `The DM must control such a proficiency very carefully to maintain play balance. Manufacturing poisons should be a long and difficult process (check the section on potion manufacture in the ***DMG***, page 87). Making poison under field conditions should require a substantial penalty, and failure under any circumstances should result in at least a chance for the poison maker to poison himself ("Ouch! I've just nicked myself with the knife I used to skin that tree frog."). Many poisons, particularly the very potent ones, should have a "shelf life" and would thus lose potency over time. They also might be destroyed when exposed to heat, cold, light, or electricity. Note that poisons are very dangerous to store ("Fine, your thief is carrying that batch of puffer-fish venom in a leather bladder on his belt. But did he remember to wash his hands before eating?").`,

I understand that the spell-caster gets the new form's movement but not its attacks. What about extraordinary movement such as tunneling or phasing? What about types of movement that might double as attacks? For instance, can a wizard ***polymorphed*** into a giant frog leap onto an opponent?`,
            answer: [
                `Basically, the ***polymorph self*** spell grants the caster the adopted form's shape an ordinary locomotion. The spell does not grant the adopted form's special attacks, senses, or magical abilities. The caster is not granted enough strength to perform extraordinary maneuvers, and the DM must decide where to draw the line when deciding what abilities the caster does get. In your example, a caster who assumed the form of a giant frog would be able to swim and hop about, but would not have a frog's all-around vision or full use of the creature's remarkable tongue. It is reasonable to deny the caster the ability to make spectacular leaps, as the spell description specifically limits the caster to "normal" movement. However, a frog's form is well suited to jumping, and the occasional long hop isn't out of the ordinary for a frog. The caster could jump, but he probably wouldn't have the strength or coordination to make very long jumps (a reduction of one-half or one-third would be about right—60-90' for a person ***polymorphed*** into a 50-lb. giant frog) or to make several leaps in succession. The caster certainly can belly flop onto opponents; resolve such attacks using the wrestling table (see the ***DMG***, page 59). Similarly, a caster who changed into an umber hulk would have a very limited ability to burrow through solid rock. A caster who took the form of a phase spider would get the ability to crawl along webs, but not the ability to shift phase or to spin webs of his own.`,

            answer: [
                `The second spell is disrupted, as a successful hit ruins a spell in progress (***Player's Handbook***, page 85). Note that a successful attack—not damage—is the critical factor here. Game logic assumes that even a nondamaging hit can disrupt concentration. It's tough to keep your mind focused on something as complex as a spell when someone's using your head for batting practice, even if the blows aren't hurting you. Many kinds of nondamaging hits can disrupt spell-casting: a hand clamped over the mouth, an armlock, or just being knocked down. However, damage always breaks concentration. If, for example, a spell-caster takes damage from a ***fireball*** or breath weapon, any spell in progress is lost even if the caster made his saving throw and took only half damage.`,
                `These distinctions also are important to game balance. Spell-casters are *intended* to be vulnerable to physical attacks during spell-casting, and their opponents *must* be given a chance to anticipate the spell and disrupt it before it goes off. Spell-casters can't get around this limitation by using spells such as ***stoneskin***. Likewise, spell-casting monsters that are immune to normal weapons (such as liches and vampires with character abilities) can have their spells ruined by any successful attacker. Some DMs even allow "attack" bonuses when characters make attacks specifically to disrupt a spell. The reasoning here is that a nondamaging jostle or cross block is easier to make than a potentially lethal blow. While this sort of ruling tends to be an equalizer when the target spell-caster is a high-level evil patriarch with an armor class in the negative numbers, it can be unreasonably tough on a 1st-level wizard with AC 10. Apply such bonuses carefully, if at all. I suggest that bonuses be limited to +4 or less, and you might consider applying them to the target's armor class rather than to the "to hit" roll. If you use the armor-class adjustment method, do not allow an armor class to be adjusted to worse than 10.`,

However, fist fighting and wrestling *can* be treated just like any other weapons that require proficiencies. If this is the case, the proficiency should be available to any character class. If a character spends a weapon proficiency on punching, he should get the extra melee attacks listed on Table 15, ***PHB***, page 26, if he is a high-level warrior. Punching specialists would use Table 35, ***PHB***, page 52.) Any character (under any punching system) attacking with both fists would use the attacking with two-weapons rule (***PHB***, page 96).

                `This is entirely up to the DM. You've listed a couple of reasonable approaches to the problem. If wishes are fairly are in the campaign, and the DM feels that the need is justified, a special ability such as lock picking might be granted for a limited time, say as much as a month (but more likely a few turns or hours). If ***wishes*** are true rarities or if the DM really approves of high-powered player characters, it's fine to make the ability permanent, but I suggest that the ability be low powered, about one-third to one-half of what the average player character in the campaign might have. It's also a good idea to make the level of power fixed, not subject to improvement though experience. It certainly is acceptable to twist such wishes by changing the character into some creature that has the desired ability; such changes might be permanent or temporary. It also is fine to have a creature possessing the desired ability appear and serve the character for a short time.`,

It does not negate encumbrance penalties, nor does it allow characters to ignore armor restrictions due to character class (not even thieves). It is important to note that magic in the AD&D game is specific and specialized; collateral effects, even those suggested by logic, usually do not occur. While a character wearing a ***ring of free action*** can ignore the effects of an ***entangle*** spell, the wearer is not granted the ability to freely move through underbrush as can a druid. Likewise, there is no reason to assume that the wearer cannot float or swim in water. (On the other hand, individual DMs might rule that this is the case, and thus give the character a new problem to think about while adventuring in or near the water.) The wearer of a ***ring of free action*** would be immune to attacks from a ***rope of entanglement***, but could be physically restrained and bound with any normal rope.

Dual-classed characters do, however, have to learn a new way of doing things when embarking on a new class, and should be given at least one new weapon proficiency (and one nonweapon proficiency if the campaign uses them) when starting the new class.

Why does attacking make the subject visible? Why doesn't the spell make objects the subject picks up disappear?`,
            answer: [
                `***Invisibility*** is illusory, and no one decides what a creature sees when gazing through an ***invisible*** creature. The recipient isn't removed; it is rendered visually undetectable. In campaigns in Lake Geneva, most people assume the spell bends light so it passes around the recipient rather than bouncing off the recipient or being blocked altogether. "Bent" light affects a creature's eyes in exactly the same way unbent light does, though very intelligent or powerful creatures have a chance to notice the bent light and get a saving throw against the effect (see the ***PHB***, page 142). There probably are many other workable explanations of the spells mechanics; for example, the retinas of a viewing creature's eyes might be rendered completely insensitive to the recipient's image. In any case, the spells effect is strictly limited to a live recipient (the spell description lists "creature touched" as the area of effect), and the spell has absolutely no power to change the way the subject's surroundings look.`,
                `If you take another look at the spell description, you'll see that items the subject picks up do become ***invisible***. For the purposes of this spell, anything the recipient can tuck into his clothing is considered part of the recipient. Attacks break the spell because the dweomer isn't powerful enough to continue hiding the recipient from creatures under attack. The instinct for self preservation sharpens the victims' perceptions, and the spell unravels.`,
                `Apparently, quite a few folks think ***invisibility*** ought to fall into the alteration school; if you are one of them, by all means go ahead and run it that way. However, one also can argue that ***invisibility*** is an enchantment because it grants the recipient the "power" to disappear—and to make objects disappear, too. ***Invisibility*** is called as an illusion because the spells primary effect is to change the way other creatures perceive the recipient (i.e., they have no visual perception of the recipient at all). As such, the spell is more akin to other perception-altering spells such as ***phantasmal force*** and ***blindness*** than to any other class of spell. (One also could argue that ***blindness*** is an alteration, since it "removes" sight, but the loss of sight is a change in the way the recipient perceives things, so the spell is classed as an illusion.)`

            ],
            answer: [
                `The people asking these questions all seem to share the same misconceptions about alignment. If questions similar to these have occurred to you, I suggest you carefully reread the section on alignments in the ***PHB***, starting on page 46. Pay special attention to the second paragraph on page 46, particularly the last sentence.`,
                `Alignments in the AD&D game are the cornerstones of characters' personalities. They help each player decide what a character's attitudes and values are, but they are guidelines, not absolute rules. The game's designers and editors do not assume that the entire spectrum of morality, ethics, and philosophy can neatly be categorized into nine strict divisions, and you shouldn't either. When picking an alignment for a player character, I suggest you spend some time thinking about what the character's disposition, principles, and sentiments are; then choose an alignment that fits the character.`,
                `Alignment is not defined by a single act. A good thief might indeed pick a pocket, and he might do so for any of many different reasons. He could lift a few coppers from an ostentatious fop to help feed a starving waif; he could filch the spell components from an opposing wizard during a combat encounter; or he might steal something outright, temporarily succumbing to greed (any character is entitled to commit the occasional slip). Note that, in the core AD&D 2nd Edition game, there are no lawful-good thieves (see ***PHB***, page 38).`,
                `I occasionally see a letter from a person who thinks of lawful-good characters as ruthless, heartless folk who relentlessly impress their own views on others, but that's the lawful-evil formula for living. "Good" implies altruism, kindness, and the ability to see that serving the welfare of others can promote one's own self interests. On the other hand, I get too many letters from people who think good characters, and lawful-good characters particularly, are doormats who'll always allow evil creatures take advantage of their nobler instincts. Not so. Lawful-good characters, especially paladins, usually have very definite ideas about what has to be done to promote goodness, and they are free to try all manner of things to achieve their goals. Torture usually is considered evil because helpless people are capriciously harmed; however, a lawful-good creature might very well use bluff, intimidation, or even stronger measures to get vital information from a captive in order to better protect the innocent or confound a great evil. One severe interrogation, administered at the right time and for the right reason, does not make an inquisition.`,
                `I get a lot of letters from people having trouble with the druidical ethos. Druids in the AD&D game believe in a "natural order" in which good, evil, law, and chaos play equally important roles. The first two paragraphs under the "ethos" heading on page 37 of the ***PHB*** explain the major elements of druidical doctrine.`,
                `Contrary to popular belief, maintaining "balance," especially on a personal scale, is not a druidical priority. According to the druidical view, there is a universal cycle that constantly shifts the cosmic balance between the eight "extreme" alignments. Even major shifts in the balance don't bother druids, since any one alignment's ascendancy is as temporary as fine summer weather. Druids are, however, on the lookout for anything that might cause the balance to "stick." In the druidical view, a universe permanently turned good or evil would either be unproductive, like a world caught in eternal summer where the harvest never comes, or sterile, like a world gripped by endless winter. However, most parties' actions are insignificant when measured on a universal scale. Even heroic adventurers don't often get the chance the affect the whole cosmos, and very few mortals ever get the opportunity to affect the balance in a way that would concern a druid.`,
                `Druids do not deliberately change their actions to reflect first one alignment, then another. Such shifts would make a druid's actions totally unpredictable, which in turn would tend to promote chaos. Druids believe that each of the eight alignments is equally valid, so it doesn't much matter to a druid which alignment his recent behavior tends to favor; any alignment will do over the short run. Druids do tend to be nonjudgemental about good, evil, law, and chaos; and they try to remain flexible and uncommitted to any single moral, legal, or philosophical system. However, druids regard interalignment struggles as part of nature, and druids serve nature. Since druids regard conflict between alignments as necessary, they do not seek to prevent their parties from continuing the struggle, nor do they resent being pulled into it themselves. Staying completely aloof or blocking their companions involvement would be as "unnatural" as trying to keep the leaves from falling in the autumn. Also, druids aren't stupid. Most parties won't take kindly to having their efforts continually stymied by a contrary druid (remember, alignment does not make characters into doormats). Being nonjudgmental, druids tend to go along with whatever their party chooses to do unless the party's actions threaten trees, crops, wild plants, and other things the druid is pledged to protect.`,

            answer: [
                `It would indeed be silly to roll the dice every time a character attempts a task. However, nobody can try to do everything and succeed all the time. To stay between these two extremes, the DM must decide how difficult a task is and decide what skills are necessary to complete it. There are some things just about anybody could do; for example, it doesn't take the rope use skill to tie one's shoes, nor does it take the carpentry skill to nail two boards together. However, some skills *look* a lot easier than they really are. Canoes, for example, have a nasty habit of moving in circles when improperly paddled. Likewise, rowboats also are fond of orbiting or not moving at all when an inexperienced oarsman tries his hand. While a character with seamanship probably shouldn't have to roll to control a boat or canoe on a calm lake, unskilled characters are in for a hard time even under such favorable conditions. Also, there are some tasks that unskilled characters cannot complete. Only a carpenter has enough knowledge to build an entire house, and only a seaman can hope to control a boat or canoe through a dangerous rapids or during a windstorm.`,
                `When adjudicating attempts that fall into the middle ground, the DM should decide how difficult the task is and how much specialized knowledge is needed for success. A skilled character probably can automatically complete an absurdly simple task even under poor conditions (perhaps failing only on a roll of 20), while an unskilled character might have to try harder. For example, a character with rope use might be able to tie his shoes with one hand or while hopping on one foot, while an unskilled character might have to make a roll. A good rule of thumb in such cases is to use the normal proficiency score reduced to one half or one quarter (round fractions down); the more difficult the task, the less chance there is for success. Consider the circumstances carefully. The world-record long jump currently is 29'2½", but this does not mean that every adventurer can leap a 10' pit with ease; encumbrance, damage, footing, lighting, even ceiling height will affect any attempt to jump. The DM should decide on a case-by-case basis using common sense. The DM should try to avoid making the campaign a slave to the proficiency system, but making the players *think* their characters out of a predicament is better than allowing them to extricate themselves by calling on skills the characters don't have.`,

                `***Magic jar*** creates all kinds difficulties for DMs. Here's an answer to tide you over until something official comes along: Any life force held in a ***magic jar*** receptacle is slain if the receptacle is destroyed (see the ***Player's Handbook***, page 170). However, unwilling victims of ***magic jar*** spells are not irrevocably slain as the caster would be if the receptacle is destroyed, as the captive life force is not an integral part of the spell as the caster's is. Note that the caster's life force must return to the receptacle before returning to his own body. If the DM feels the need to discourage player characters from using ***magic jar*** as a cheap way to slay opponents, it's fine to set a high value on the crystal or gem required for the receptacle, to prohibit the caster from replacing receptacles when they are destroyed (thus trapping the caster in the host body), or both.`,

The caster must make a to-hit roll for each bolt; range modifiers do not apply to the roll, but dexterity adjustments do. The DM might wish to allow an additional +2 to-hit bonus as in the ***Melf's minute meteors*** spell. The fiery bolts are a magical attack and can affect just about any creature. Note that the bolts inflict minor piercing damage (1d6) and fire damage (4d6, save for half); creatures that are immune to only one of these forms of damage still suffer the other form of damage if struck. If the caster directs one or more bolts at a magic-resistant creature, the creature makes one magic resistance roll for the volley; if it succeeds, the entire volley is negated.

A creature need not be alive. On the other hand, magically controlled creatures still are creatures even when not acting independently. Animated nonliving objects (excluding skeletons and zombies) are not creatures, whether magically or mechanically animated. If the DM uses science-fiction monsters such as sentient robots or androids, he should decide when they are introduced whether to treat such entities as objects or creatures. Nonsentient plants probably should not be considered creatures for purposes of low-level ***polymorph*** magicks.

                `There are several magical items that work only for specific classes. In each case, game logic and game balance play a role. Game logic in this case is unclear, but it probably goes something like this: The potions enhance, not create, the warrior potential in a character. Zero-level characters and warriors have the potential to be enhanced, but members of other classes do not. The latter have abandoned or suppressed any warrior potential while training to become members of their own classes. Game balance demands that there be distinct differences between classes. Class specialization in the AD&D game helps to insure that all characters are not near-clones trying to achieve the same menu of skills and abilities. Clearly defined character classes also make teamwork necessary, since one or two characters cannot do everything that might be required for successful adventures. This also promotes role-playing and campaign longevity. Most magical items that duplicate class abilities are class specific. Otherwise, class distinctions would disappear and a typical party would become a homogeneous mix of wizards turned healers, wand-toting fighters, sword-swinging priests, and scrying rogues.`,

            answer: [
                `If the question comes up during play, it's best to decide quickly. Keeping the game moving is more important than making a precise calculation. I suggest that you assume that any monster has average ability scores (about 10). Just roll a 1d20 for ability checks; if the result is 10 or less, assume the creature passes the check.`,
                `If the roll is higher, start figuring: Roll 1d3 to get the base ability score. In the case of dexterity, add one or two to the base score if the creature is described as agile, quick, or sure footed (subtract one or two for clumsy creatures). You might add a point for a high movement rate and one point for every multiple of three that the land or water movement rate rises above 12 or every multiple of six for air movement above 18 (you can subtract points at the same rate for exceptionally slow creatures). Generally, creatures with multiple legs are more sure footed than bipedal creatures, allowing one point for each pair of legs after the first two. The situation will exclude some modifiers; a horse might get modifiers for speed and legs when determining if it can jump a fence, but it might get none for deciding if it slides down a rocky slope. On the other hand, a basilisk probably couldn't jump over a matchbox but would get credit for its eight legs when negotiating slopes. Giants are notoriously clumsy, but their sheer size allows them to simply ignore most obstacles.`,
                `When calculating other ability scores, consider the following: Strength generally equates to size; tiny creatures might receive a -2, small creatures a -1, man-sized creatures no modifier, large creatures a +1, and so on. Creatures especially noted for strength, such as draft horses, might get an extra point or two. If a creature has any damage modifiers from strength, use Table 1 in the ***PHB*** to estimate its strength score. Wisdom generally equates to intelligence, with an extra point or two if the creature has priest spells or is noted for its cunning or guile. Most monsters have higher than normal constitutions (say 11-13), modified for size as per strength. Most monsters have low charismas (say 8-10) with extra points added for high intelligence and times when a creature deals with other monsters of the same alignment. Needless to say, it's always better to go through this process *before* play begins when possible.`

If the labyrinth's "shifting planes of force" are similiar to ***walls of force***, sighted victims would have to feel or sound the way out, as the planes would be invisible. In any case, the spell description implies that the labyrinth is a visually confusing place, so blind victims should have no extra difficulty escaping and creatures well adapted to blindness might escape more easily at the DM's option. Local conditions can make ***teleportation*** of any kind impossible, and the labyrinth would seem to be one of those places.

            answer: [
                `Magic resistance comes into play only when the ***anti-magic shell*** spell could directly affect the resistant creature. A conjured or summoned magic-resistant creature would be hedged out by an ***anti-magic shell***, and its magic resistance, regardless of its source, would come into play. If the magic-resistance roll succeeds, the ***anti-magic shell*** collapses, as would any other in-place spell (see the ***DMG***, page 67). If the magic-resistant creature is not conjured or summoned, it is not hedged out, but its magic and magical items cease functioning while within the ***anti-magic shell***. If a conjured or summoned creature fails its magic resistance roll, it is hedged out by the ***anti-magic shell*** and all its abilities and items work normally. However, the ***anti-magic shell*** continues to negate any of the creature's magical effects that are cast into it. In no case does magic resistance allow nonartifact magical items to continue functioning inside an intact ***anti-magic shell***. Note that a magic-resistant creature inside an ***anti-magic shell*** still is magic resistant, but this usually is irrelevant as no mortal magic works within that spell.`,

I've always assumed that ***phantasmal force*** can create only one image, so I said no. Was I correct? Can a ***phantasmal force*** spell be used to hide people? Can it make a party on a road look like just a road?`,

All the terms are singular, and this probably isn't an accident. On the other hand, one can play around a bit with the word "force." The term "force" indicates things that are not physical objects but that have physical effects, such as lightning—but a group of beings organized into a military unit or for other purposes also is a "force." I once saw an interesting compromise between these two views: The DM allowed ***phantasmal*** units of creatures, but only if all the creatures in a unit were identical and only if they all moved and acted together. It also isn't contrary to the spirit of the rules to allow ***phantasmal*** cave-ins or avalanches. If you interpret the description narrowly, these are out of the question because they are made up of many small objects; however, the individual objects *are* part of a larger whole. Note that anything created by a ***phantasmal force*** spell (and its cousins, the ***improved phantasmal force***, ***spectral force***, and ***advanced illusion spells***) is strictly limited to the spells immobile area of effect. A ***phantasmal*** creature, for example, can move but must remain entirely within the area of effect.`,

            question: `When designing a custom spelljamming vessel, how do you define the ship's tonnage, maneuverability class, and crew requirements? How much does it cost to build a spelljammer from scratch?`,
            answer: [
                `This is a topic is too complex to deal with here. Until something official comes along, which may happen in 1992, individual DMs must make these decisions on a case-by-case basis by comparing ships designed for their campaigns with the ship statistics given on pages 28-33 of the ***Concordance of Arcane Space***, from the SPELLJAMMER boxed set. Here are a few unofficial suggestions for determining statistics and costs for new types of spelljammers:`,
                `A quick way to estimate a new ship's tonnage is to multiply its beam length by its keel length, then divide by 120 or 125. This works well only for the oblong hull types such as hammerships. Generally, a ship can carry one person per ton of displacement, and it requires one crew member per three tons of displacement. Converted groundling ships and large, blocky ships, such as neogi deathspiders and dwarven citadels, have poor maneuverability ratings (E or F). Compact, barrel-shaped ships, such as squid ships and hammerships, have midrange ratings (C or D), and light ships with lots of sail area have high ratings (A or B). Judging from the repair rules on page 70 of the ***Concordance***, building a ship from scratch is much more expensive than buying one "as is!" About 1,000 gp per ton seems to be an accurate figure for medium-sized, fairly maneuverable ships (30-60 tons, maneuverability class D) made of thick wood. This cost does not include large weapons or motive power, though the builder might offer the purchaser a package deal. Highly maneuverable ships, or ships made of metal or ceramics, would cost more per ton. The 1,000 gp/ton figure is significantly lower than the repair costs, but I assume the listed repair costs reflect quite a bit of haste and desperation.`,

                `Designating the ship with the initiative as the attacker seems to be a good ruling to me. I suggest re-rolling a simultaneous initiative right before the ramming attempts take place.

                `The ship retains its own gravity until it touches the planet's surface; see page 14 of the ***Concordance*** for details. Note that the ship immediately drops out of spelljamming speed as soon as it enters the planet's gravity. A "planet" is here considered to be anything that displaces at least 10 tons. Note also that when two objects touch, the larger object's gravity is dominant. For example, a 50-ton ship touching a 20-ton asteroid imposes *its* gravity on the asteroid. Individual DMs might rule that certain planets immediately override a ship's gravity when the ship enters their gravity wells. This might be due to those planets' sheer size (each being, say, 100 times the ship's displacement), or it could simply be those planets' inherent properties, regardless of relative size.`,

                `How long a helmsman must rest before casting spells is up to the DM. The helmsman must rest for as long as normal for him to regain the spells he currently has memorized; spelljamming does not erase the spells' patterns from the helmsman's brain, but it does disrupt the flow of magical energies within it (see page 34 of the ***Concordance***). The minimum time required to regain spell-casting ability is "a restful night's sleep" (see the 2nd Edition ***Player's Handbook***, page 81). For spelljamming purposes, this probably should be eight hours, though it may be slightly shorter or longer if the DM assigns a rest requirement that varies with the level or type of spells to be cast.

However, if the air envelope is small enough (created by an object of 10 tons displacement or less), the air is immediately fouled if it wasn't already, which might cause problems for living creatures who depend on the air envelope. Poison-gas breath weapons from dragons, such as those of green and gold dragons, immediately foul air envelopes unless their tonnage is more than five times the dragon's hit dice. However, green and gold dragons are immune to gas attacks and are unharmed by air that has been fouled by such attacks, including ***stinking clouds***, ***cloudkills***, and similar spells; as far as the dragon is concerned air made foul by such attacks still is fresh, and it remains fresh for the normal period of time.`,

            answer: [
                `This question sparked quite a bit of debate among my colleagues at TSR, Inc. However, the consensus is the swords ***sunray*** power works exactly as described in the swords description (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 185), not like the ***sunray*** spell. DMs are free to decide if the swords ***sunray*** power can be used while attacking; it's reasonable to assume the vigorous overhead swinging required to evoke the ***sunray*** would preclude attacks. On the other hand, the rules aren't precise about what vigorous overhead swinging really is, so it's not unreasonable to assume that the wielder can't just add an overhead flourish or two while attacking. If you decide to allow attacks while maintaining the ***sunray***, you might want to impose a to-hit or initiative penalty (say, -2), or both. Note that a dim glow persists for one turn after the swinging stops, no matter which option you choose.`,

            answer: [
                `This question sparked only slightly less spirited arguments that the previous one. The "beams" are spherical bursts of light with a 5' radius. No glow surrounds the caster, but the caster can create one burst each round (unless he is attacking or performing some other action other than movement) anywhere within the spell's range. I can't think of any overwhelming reason to assume that the caster should know how long the spell will last. How-ever, an unknown and variable duration might make casting this high-level spell far too chancy for some campaigns. A reasonable compromise might be to keep the total duration secret from the caster, but tell him if the spell has ended before he declares his actions for the round (see the ***PHB***, page 93).`,

Can two different girdles be worn at the same time (e.g., a ***girdle of many pouches*** and a ***girdle of giant strength***)? Can magical cloaks be worn with magical robes? Can magical boots be worn over magical slippers?`,
            answer: [
                `First, let's define a few terms for gaming purposes: A ***bracer*** is a forearm protector. It can be as compact as a very wide bracelet or large enough to cover the whole forearm; bracers are made of metal, leather, or heavy cloth. A ***gauntlet*** is a hand protector that covers at least the wrist and back of the hand, although it might also cover the fingers and most of the forearm; gauntlets are made of metal, leather and metal, leather, or heavy cloth. A glove at least covers the palm and back of the hand, though it can go from the fingers all the way above the elbow. A ***girdle*** is a belt, simple or elaborate, worn about the waist or hips. A ***robe*** is a garment fitted to the body and usually worn over other clothing; minimally, a robe covers the torso from the neck to the waist, but usually is longer. A robe may or may not have sleeves. Any garment that covers the body, from a shirt to a dress, might be called a robe. A ***cloak***, ***cape***, or ***mantle*** is a loose, usually sleeveless outer garment hung from the shoulders and worn over other clothing. Generally, a cloak is long and full, covering the body from the neck to below the knees and sometimes to the ankles. A cape is shorter and narrower than a cloak, covering the back from the neck to the waist. but sometimes longer. A mantle covers the shoulders, front and back. Cloaks, mantles, and robes can be hooded, but capes are not. Boots are sturdy, close-fitting garments that cover the foot from toe to ankle and sometimes the entire leg as well. ***Slippers*** are lightweight and cover the soles of the feet, toes, and heels, but might cover the ankles as well.`,
                `Generally, two or more items can be worn together if they cover different parts of the body. There are both logical and game-balance reasons for this. Obviously, a character wearing two or more cloaks is going to be just as overly powered as a character wearing three or more rings. Furthermore, game logic assumes a magical garment must fit reasonably well to function. The items cease to function if a character layers them on until he looks like a walking laundry basket.`,
                `Some garments do overlap in normal use. A robe can be worn with a cape, mantle, or cloak, but a character can wear only one robe and one cape, mantle, or cloak. Bracers can be worn with gloves or gauntlets. Some gauntlets are made to be worn over gloves; indeed, there is no reason why a campaign can't have some gauntlets that fit over gloves and some that do not. Many people in the Middle Ages wore two belts; one was high on the waist to hold up breeches or hose and to hold pouches and tools, and one rode on the hips, usually to support a sword or other large weapon. Sometimes people wore two belts crossed over the hips and a third on the waist. I suggest that two magical belts or girdles be the absolute limit, and only if they have different functions (e.g., one that augments ability scores or skills, such as a ***girdle of giant strength***, and one for carrying equipment, such as a ***girdle of many pouches***). A character can wear only one set of outer footgear. Any garment thin enough to be worn inside a pair of shoes or boots would be called a sock, not a slipper.`

            question: `The introduction to the 2nd Edition ***Legends & Lore*** tome says deities are unable to visit the Prime Material plane, yet the Aztec deities are described as living on the Prime Material plane. Are they exceptions to the rule? Are these deities restricted to their home planets? If so, how can Quetzalcoatl keep his vow to return to the valley of Mexico? How can Ometeotl be barred from going anywhere if he's the embodiment of the universe? How can an omnipotent deity such as this have such limits, and why would such a deity need an avatar? Tezcatlipoca is said to he unable to visit this Prime Material plane; isn't this another contradiction?`,
            answer: [
                `First, a careful rereading of page 6 of ***Legends & Lore*** will show that deities are not unable to visit the Prime Material plane, but they never do; this is because doing so automatically would draw the attention and ire of the other deities. No deity is inclined to risk destruction at the hands if his or her divine peers.`,
                `The Aztec deities section does seem to be a bit muddy, but less so if you assume the words "Prime Material Plane" actually mean "the planet where the campaign takes place" or "the valley of Mexico." Like beings in other pantheons, the Aztec deities are quite interested in mortal affairs and won't tolerate direct divine interference in them. Exactly how Quetzalcoatl will keep his vow is up to the DM. Perhaps the other deities will respect it and allow him to return, or perhaps Quetzalcoatl expects his followers to pave the way for him in such a way as the other deities ***cannot*** object.`,
                `If you carefully reread Ometeotl's section, you'll find he is the embodiment of the universe only in a sense, not literally. In any case, no deity in ***Legends & Lore*** is omnipotent, not even in its own area of control. All deities share the limelight with other deity-class creatures who have the power to confound or even kill them. Avatars are handy for any deity, as an avatar can go places where the deity itself cannot go without recriminations. Also, note that deities can have multiple avatars working at different locations at the same time (10 avatars at once for a greater deity). Likewise, Tezcatlipoca is not ***barred*** from the mortal world any more than any other deity. He is in the habit of using his true form—rather than an avatar—to accomplish various tasks. However, he doesn't use his true form to visit the mortal world.`

            question: `If deities never visit the Prime Material plane, how can the cambion Iuz live on Oerth (in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK® setting)? I run a campaign based in Oerth, and Iuz is a major villain. With the appearance of the new ***Legends & Lore*** tome, do I remove Iuz from Oerth and from the game, or leave the demigod free to ravage the place? Do the new rules have information on cambions? Where do I find rules on Iuz's assassin abilities, or do they just disappear now that the new rules have come along?`,
            answer: [
                `Statistics for cambions are located in the ***Monstrous Compendium***, Outer Planes appendix, under the heading "Tanar'ri." If you decide to treat Iuz like any other deity and restrict his true form to another plane, you hardly remove him from play. As a demigod, he can have his worshipers or even his avatar do his dirty work. (Yes, I'm aware that the ***GREYHAWK® Adventures*** hardback says Iuz has no avatars, but if you're going to kick him off the Prime Material plane because of what ***Legends & Lore*** says, there's no reason you can't give him an avatar.) Note also that the ***Legends & Lore*** tome does not necessarily consider the way things work on Oerth; it is a general work describing how deity-class creatures fit into most campaigns. I can't think of a single reason why you can't have Iuz continue to prowl about the Flanaess, causing as much trouble as ever. Also, since Iuz is pretty weak as most demigods go, he probably can be slain by mortal attacks, unlike the more powerful demigods described in ***Legends & Lore***.`,

                `A ***wand of negation*** prevents devices from generating magical effects. A ***wand of negation*** does not affect creatures or existing magical effects, though many readers have gotten confused while reading the wands description (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 157) and concluded otherwise.

Note that the ***wand of negation*** need not be pointed directly at the item to be negated; it suffices to point the wand at the individual employing the item. The DM must decide what constitutes a "spell-like effect"; magical bonuses cannot be negated, nor can most other functions that affect only the item's user, such as ***necklaces of adaptation*** or ***brooms of flying***. Devices that create offensive magical effects such as ***fireballs***, ***lightning bolts***, ***shooting stars***, ***polymorph other***, and so on can be negated.

            question: `The various SPELLJAMMER™ rules hooks say that weapons can he added to a ship at the cost of one ton of cargo space per weapon, to a maximum number of weapons equal to half the ship's tonnage. Since cargo space also is equal to half the ship's tonnage, this means that all the ship's cargo space can be used up by extra weapons. I have two problems with this: First, what do cargo space and weapons have to do with each other? Second, the rule allows a ridiculously large number of weapons to be mounted on ships. A hammership, for example, at 60 tons, can mount 30 additional weapons!`,
            answer: [
                `The maximum number of additional weapons a ship can carry ***is*** one per two tons of displacement (***Concordance of Arcane Space***, pages 26-27). However, this is a theoretical number based on a ship's gross hauling capacity. Even a quick look at the deck plans in the SPELLJAMMER boxed set reveals that cramming a spelljammer with its maximum load of weapons would take *all* the ship's deck space. Of course, a truly warlike spelljammer captain might build a "double-topped" ship with fighting decks above and below the plane of gravity, but woe to the weapons' crews if the gravity plane shifts.`,
                `Speaking of crews, general-purpose spelljammers, such as most PCs would use, don't have the quarters or air necessary to sustain a huge number of weapons crews; this tends to lower the practical limit on the number of weapons a ship is likely to have. (On the other hand, a "monitor"-type ship dedicated to defending a planet, base, or section of wildspace might be packed to its crow's nest with weaponry, and ships crewed by undead would have no breathing-air restrictions.) Also, don't forget that weapons aren't free and are not available in unlimited quantities.`,
                `Extra weapons eat up cargo space for a variety of reasons. First, a ship's cargo capacity is an abstract figure that reflects both its interior volume and its ability to carry weight. A weapons-heavy ship might have empty space in its hull, but if overloaded with cargo it would probably maneuver like a wounded duck and have a nasty tendency to split open like a wet cardboard box in combat or when landing. Also, large weapons can't just be bolted onto a ship's deck; their mounts must be braced and supported so the weapons don't break loose when fired. This extra structure not only reduces the ship's payload, it also tends to make the ship less efficient as a cargo carrier (the extra posts and beams prevent the crew from packing cargo tightly, and they otherwise waste space). Also, don't forget that large weapons need ammunition, and some of the ship's cargo space has to be allocated to its storage.`

The most straightforward reading of the SPELLJAMMER material suggests to me that all the crystal spheres and the phlogiston that connects them are part of a *single* Prime Material plane, which makes the planar universe a very big place indeed. However, there is no reason why you can't assume that each crystal sphere is itself a *separate* Prime Material Plane, with all the variable properties described in the ***Manual of the Planes***. Note that if this is true, spelljammers would visit some spheres at their own peril. In a campaign with such a planar setup, astral and ethereal travel might very well be a workable alternative to spelljamming. With a little work, you could merge the SPELLJAMMER setting into the ***DMG's*** planar setup, treating each crystal sphere as a Prime Material plane and making the phlogiston part of the Astral or Ethereal plane, or eliminate the phlogiston and replace it with the Astral or Ethereal plane.`,

The reason why the caster must say what spell he is trying to recreate with the ***reckless dweomer*** is pretty obvious (and I've seen it pointed out once on the GEnie computer networks "TSR RoundTable"). The ***reckless dweomer*** uses the Wild Surge Results table (***TOM***, page 7) to determine what happens.

I suppose a ***prayer*** spell could be cast once in conjunction with a ***focus*** to permanently consecrate the site.

            answer: [
                `Whether or not an effect is natural has no bearing on whether or not it is subject to magic resistance. Magically created effects ignore magic resistance only if they are consequential. The rules governing magic resistance (***PHB***, page 102, or ***DMG***, page 66) use crevices created by an ***earthquake*** spell as an example. The spell ***earthquake*** does not create crevices; it creates tremors that in turn create crevices. As another example, lightning is a natural effect on the Prime Material plane and elsewhere. Nevertheless, a ***lightning bolt*** is an area-effect spell subject to magic resistance.`,
                `Magic resistance, however, cannot protect a creature against a huge stalactite or weakened wall broken loose by a ***lightning bolt***. Nor can it protect an exposed creature from random lightning strikes generated from a thunderstorm created by ***control weather*** or ***weather summoning*** spells. These last two spells do not create or control lightning; they change and agitate the atmosphere in such a way as to make lightning possible. Note that ***call lightning*** creates and directs lightning on demand, and that each stroke called is an area effect subject to magic resistance. The spell ***ice storm*** can create damage-inflicting missiles that are subject to magic resistance, as is any other area of effect spell. However, a magic-resistant creature still is blinded, slowed, and vulnerable to slipping and falling if subjected to the sleet version of an ***ice storm***, because these are consequential effects.`,

If the spell's baton strikes a magic-resistant creature and the magic-resistance roll succeeds, the baton collapses.

                `In the core AD&D 2nd Edition game, there are no druid/rangers. The reference to them on page 22 is an error, and that is why they don't appear in the table on page 44. In practice, however, druid/rangers work very well in play, offering a good mix of skills and lots of role-playing possibilities.`,
                `To determine the weapons and armor allowed to druid/rangers (if the DM decides to allow these characters at all), follow the rules on page 45 of the ***PHB***. Since a warrior priest must abide by the weapon restrictions of his mythos, the druid/ranger's weapons are limited to: club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, sling, and staff. The druid/ranger also must observe the druids special armor restrictions, thus being limited to leather armor and wooden shields. Since rangers must be good and druids must be neutral, alignment is a problem. I suggest that a druid/ranger's alignment be limited to neutral good.`,
                `Note that the rules on page 45—especially the weapons restrictions—tend to discourage multiclassed priests except for characters dedicated to the appropriate deities. For example warrior priests who follow war deities might have access to a useful selection of warrior armor and weapons (***PHB***, page 34) and will be far more effective as warriors than, say warrior clerics, who are limited to blunt weapons. Since the original rationale behind druid/rangers is that these two woodland professions have enough common interests to generate at least a few multiclassed characters, and since the druid/ranger by necessity already violates the druid's alignment restriction, the DM might wish to bend the rules a bit to allow druid/rangers to function more effectively as rangers. The best way to do this is to expand the weapons list to include at least one kind of bow and maybe the warrior's mainstay, the long sword. The DM also might consider lifting or altering the armor restriction.

            question: `The ***shadow monsters*** and ***demi-shadow monsters*** spells are listed under the illusion/phantasm school, but their descriptions say they draw matter from the plane of Shadow to create illusions of one or more monsters. Doesn't this make these spells conjuration/summonings or evocation/invocations? What happens if the caster isn't connected with the plane of Shadow at all? I suppose the spell might be partially successful even in this case if it were truly an illusion. Also, what is the difference between an illusion and a phantasm?`,
            answer: [
                `The spells in question are illusion/phantasms because their primary function is to make their victims believe in something that doesn't really exist. The inclusion of a small amount of extraplanar material make these spells very potent illusions (it is because of this trace of "real" material that they can inflict damage even if successfully disbelieved), but it does not make them conjuration/summonings. A full-blown conjuration/summoning or evocation/invocation brings forth a "real" object or creature, not one whose existence is diminished by active disbelief. If local conditions make a connection between the caster and the plane of Shadow impossible, then casting either of these spells also is impossible; it's all or nothing.`,
                `In game terms, there is very little difference between an illusion and a phantasm, which is why the two words usually are used together. Technically speaking, however, an phantasm exists only in the victim's mind (e.g., ***phantasmal killer***), whereas an illusion is a sensory impression that any being might perceive if close enough. The various ***phantasmal force*** spells are true illusions, in spite of the name. The distinction usually is immaterial in campaign play and should be ignored in most cases.`

One of his favorite spells is ***wall of fog***, which is quite effective in our campaign, and he causes a lot of trouble with it. Is this spell really an invocation/evocation spell, or is this a misprint?`,
            answer: [
                `Like all the other "wall" spells, ***wall of fog*** is an evocation. It is so classed because it brings into being something that wasn't there before the spell was cast.`,
                `A great deal of game logic and concern for game balance underlies the schools as they presently are constructed, and I don't recommend fiddling with them, especially if you are using specialist wizards. The team who revised the game carefully considered the number of spells in each school and the kinds of adventuring "niches" each specialist would tend to fill, which is why spells with similar effects tend to fall into the same school even if the mechanics behind them don't seem to match at first glance. I also suggest that trying to second guess the game's designers is not the best way to role-play dealing with a rival. Having your character slip a raw egg into the rival character's boot is much more likely to produce an entertaining result than trying to tinker with the rules. If there's one thing more annoying than a rules lawyer, it's a rules lawyer who wants to change the rules.`,

            answer: [
                `Generally, a character can make the same number of nonlethal attacks each round as he would be allowed to make in normal melee. I can't see any reason why a character couldn't get an extra punching attack each round by using the rules for attacking with two weapons (***PHB***, page 96), but remember to apply the appropriate penalties. A character has to use pretty much his whole body to wrestle or overbear, so you can't use the rules for attacking with two weapons to get an extra overbearing or wrestling attack each round. However, a high-level warrior who is allowed two attacks in a round *could* make two overbearing or wrestling attacks. In the case of overbearing, the warrior could knock down an opponent, then try to pin him. In the case of wrestling, the warrior could make two attempts to gain a hold, but if he gets a hold that can be maintained, damage from round to round accrues normally, not at a doubled rate.`,

                `Once created, a ***simulacrum*** is completely independent of the original and its creator, except that it must obey commands from its creator. Damage to the original or the original's premature death do not affect the ***simulacrum*** in the least. The ***simulacrum*** also ignores damage to the creator, and the only effect that the creator's death has is that the ***simulacrum*** no longer has someone that it must obey. *Since* a ***simulacrum*** is a fairly accurate replica of the original, its natural lifespan will be about as long as the original's; I suggest that it be exactly the same 40%-65% of the time.

            answer: [
                `According to page 110 of ***The Complete Psionics Handbook***, an ***anti-magic shell*** has no effect at all on psionics. The game logic behind this rule is that magic—which includes such special attacks such as breath and gaze weapons—and psionics are two different things. In terms of game balance, it is desirable to draw a firm line between magic use and psionics use. Psionics, the reasoning goes, is a type of power completely different from magic in all its various forms.`,
                `However, my colleagues at TSR, Inc. have made it clear to me that *all* the rules in the various handbooks are optional. Considering that ***anti-magic shells*** can stop things like gaze attacks, sonic attacks, and breath weapons—all of which ignore magic resistance—I don't think you'd be stretching things too far if you assumed the field created by an ***anti-magic shell*** stopped all preternatural effects of nondivine, nonartifact origin. Both magic and psionics involve the transfer and manipulation of some kind of power, and an ***anti-magic shell*** can be assumed to prevent the passage of such power.`,
                `Nevertheless, I suggest you tread carefully when mixing magic and psionics. Psionic powers are potent and must be adjudicated carefully even if you follow all the rules scrupulously. For example, if you blur the line between magic and psionics by introducing magical items that augment or bestow psionic powers, characters who accumulate a few of them can quickly become psionic juggernauts.`

Exactly how the user is rendered invisible is left up to the DM.

Finally, note that some illusion/phantasm spells have normal saving throws (fear, for example); victims need not make disbelieve attempts vs. any spell whose save is listed as "Neg." In such cases, the saving-throw rules apply, not the disbelief rules. Note also that several illusion/phantasms, such as ***mirror image*** have no save at all.

                `This is up to the DM, but I see no reason why something as simple as a general enchantment should be lost in this case. Abilities that might depend on the weapon's size and weight probably *should* be lost. The spell description (***PHB***, page 191) uses a ***vorpal sword***, ***polymorphed*** into a dagger, as an example; since daggers are not really suited to chopping and severing, the sword loses its ***vorpal*** ability. On the other hand, a ***vorpal sword*** that has been ***polymorphed*** into a bardiche probably would keep its ability to sever necks. Very intelligent magical weapons changed into any form probably should lose some of their abilities when in ***polymorphed*** form even if these abilities have nothing to do with the weapon's size or configuration. Such weapons are the result of a long and intricate process, and even subtle changes in the weapon's form can disrupt the enchantment. DMs must decide what happens on a case-by-case basis, but the more abilities the weapons has, the more likely that even a small change in form will cause one or more of the abilities to become inactive; of course, large changes will disrupt even more of the weapon's powers.`,

Is a saving throw required for each charge?`,

                `In healthy campaigns, magical-item creation is a long and arduous process; if it were not so, player characters wouldn't have much reason to risk life and limb on adventures. However, a little common sense and a careful rereading of the rules should shorten the time to create the ***wand of magic missiles*** in your example. First, the item's creator must gather the proper materials. This could take days, weeks, or months of game time, depending on how rare the DM decides to make the materials and how intelligently the character goes about gathering them. Since the quest for materials helps move the campaign along, the actual time required here really is irrelevant.`,
                `Once the character has gathered and prepared the materials (***Dungeon Master's Guide***, pages 87-88), he must cast ***enchant an item***, which takes 1d8 + 2 days (at eight hours a day). Then the item makes a saving throw, and the initial spell is cast on it, which takes 2-8 hours per spell level. A ***permanency*** spell is then required to fix the enchantment and prepare the item to receive charges. Once this is done, I suggest you use the rules for recharging magical items (***DMG***, pages 88-89). Each charge requires a separate spell with the normal casting time. As suggested in issue #172, the item needn't make a saving throw each time a charge is added, but the item does need to make a saving throw when "recharging" starts, and the creator is still limited to eight hours of work a day (or a full "load" of spells dumped into the item, whichever is less). During the whole time, the caster must stringently follow the requirements of the ***enchant an item*** spell (***PHB***, page 176).`,

            answer: [
                `The exact extent of the sorcerer-kings' power over their templars is unrevealed, but I don't find anything in the rules that implies that they know what's on all their templars' minds all the time, or that the act of granting spells allows the sorcerer-king to know all a templar's thoughts. Since all sorcerer-kings are accomplished psionicists, however, they would carefully examine the thoughts of at least their higher-level templars; this makes it unlikely that "moles" exist in any city's templar hierarchy. Likewise, a city-state's totalitarian government, the general populace's hatred and distrust of the templars, the sorcerer-king's shrewdness, and the obvious rewards available to any templar who embarrasses a superior or crushes a misbehaving subordinate make it pretty unlikely that any disloyal templar will survive for long. Finally, consider that all templars are either neutral or evil, and that the quickest way a templar can become wealthy and powerful is to remain loyal but corrupt. I don't think there would be undiscovered traitors in the templar ranks even if there could be.`,

Since all the attack and defense modes are telepathic sciences or devotions that are not listed on Table 12, the character can get them only if he rolls a 90 and gets to pick any two devotions, or rolls 91-00 and gets to roll on Table 13 (if he's very lucky and rolls a 00, he can pick a devotion and roll on Table 13). Since attack and defense modes also are not included on Table 13, the character can get them only if he continues to be lucky and rolls one of the "choose any" results on Table 13. Barring such good die rolls or some type of DM intervention, characters with wild talents don't get attack and defense modes.`,

A character must refer to the Racial Ability Requirements table (actually Table 1; Rules Book, page 3) before applying the modifiers from Table 2 (also on page 3). Athasian halflings, however, probably should be at least as strong as halflings on other worlds, and maybe stronger. It's not unreasonable to give Athasian halflings a final strength limit of 18; however, Athasian halflings with 18 strength still do not roll for extraordinary strength, as their small bodies just don't carry enough muscle.`,

            answer: [
                `Strictly speaking, you treat extraordinary strength exactly the way you do on any other world. That is, warriors with strengths of 18 roll on the extraordinary-strength portion of Table 1 in the ***PHB*** (page 14), and other characters don't. While a nonwarrior on Athas might be blessed with a great strength score, he doesn't have the training or discipline that allows a warrior to develop a strength score of 18 into something outstanding.`,
                `I know of one non-Athasian campaign that dispenses with extraordinary strength altogether. Under this house rule, a warrior with a 13 strength gets the benefits of an 18 strength, a warrior with a 14 strength gets the benefits of an 18/01 strength, and so on up to strength 18. The DM I met who used this rule claimed it made having that elusive 18 strength score less vital to the warrior. Nonwarriors, who have less physical training, used the regular strength table. Even if you adopt this rule, however, you'll still have a situation where a nonwarrior with a 19 or better strength score has vastly better combat modifiers than characters—even warriors—who have strength scores of 18 or less.`

            answer: [
                `A thri-kreen's hands and arms can certainly perform sign language of some kind. Since the Athasian sign language is the closest thing to a planet-wide tongue that Athas has, it's probably safe to assume that sign language takes into account and adjusts for differences between human and thri-kreen hands. (Even with all the differences described in the rules, there would literally be millions of gestures that both thri-kreen and human hands could preform.) The DM, however, might decide that the thri-kreen have their own version of sign language or that the physical differences in hands cause an ability-check penalty when humans or demi-humans use sign language to communicate with thri-kreen.`,
                `I'll spare my regular readers the standard sermon about racial-class and level restrictions and why they are necessary for game balance, and I'll plunge directly into a discussion about why thri-kreen don't become thieves or templars:`,
                `Thri-kreen are born hunters and warriors. Those thri-kreen who have a talent or liking for stealth and concealment become rangers, not thieves. Skulking about and playing with locks, traps, poisons, and other nefarious devices just doesn't suit this race. Thri-kreen also are hive creatures who are very dedicated and loyal to their group, even if there are non-thri-kreen in it and even if the individual thri-kreen in question is evil. The deceit, corruption, disdain for underlings, and disrespect for superiors displayed by the templars is completely alien to the thri-kreen.`

Just because a thri-kreen can attack with four claws does not mean it can coordinate four weapons at once. Before somebody writes and asks: No, this does not mean thri-kreen cannot hurl more than two missiles each round; they get the full rate of fire listed in the rules for darts and similar hand-hurled missiles (but they can't use their extra hands to get a rate of fire better than that listed in the rules). Statistics on four-handed weapons are up to the DM; however, I suggest that limits on thri-kreen strength and coordination make such weapons no more effective than two-handed weapons. Note also that thri-kreen can bite while wielding weapons, but they cannot claw while doing so. I suppose a kind DM might allow a thri-kreen to use a claw as a secondary weapon under the "Attacking with Two Weapons" rule in the ***PHB***, page 96.`,

The worst effects of blowing sand are reduced visibility (Rules Book, page 84) and the fact that sand tends to get into everything, like clothing, armor, equipment, and provisions. Athas, however, probably has more than its share of extraordinary sandstorms. The DM will have to handle these on a case-by-case basis. I suggest that characters escape damage altogether if they have shelter of any sort (a tent or the lee side of any barrier such as a boulder, hill, or stand of cactus). Characters exposed to the full force of the wind might suffer 1-2 six-sided dice of damage per hour, turn, or minute, depending on how ferocious the storm is.

As for beholders, I can think of at least three reasons why they aren't listed in the rules: 1) They're all dead, because Athas is a tough place; 2) They never were there in the first place; not every world boasts all the species described in the ***Monstrous Compendium***; 3) They are around, all right, but are very rare and still lurking deep underground, waiting for a few unlucky Athasians to show up for dinner.

            question: `Does a saving throw or magic resistance apply to a ***warp marble's*** various effects? Can a creature trapped in the marble be freed by a ***dispel magic*** spell?`,
            answer: [
                `According to the item description (see ***Tome of Magic***, page 148) a saving throw applies only when the marble is set as a trap using the third command word and hurled at a creature. If the marble hits, the victim gets a save. If the item is set as a trap with the third command word, any creature touching it is trapped, with no saving throw. Likewise, the creature closest to the marble is automatically trapped when the first command word is spoken. The DM easily can prevent abuse of this ability by making the command word effective only at a very short range (I suggest 10'-20') and by introducing opponents who are inclined to crush untended marbles or hurl or kick them toward the owner or his party-in the latter case, the marble might trap the owner or one of his allies if the initiative roll turns out well. Likewise, I suggest that ***warp marbles*** develop a bad habit of bouncing around unpredictably when thrown, thus encouraging owners to use the third command word when handling them (since a bad bounce might inadvertantly trap a character employing the first command word). Note also that ***warp marbles*** can be safely manipulated with spears, other long implements, ***unseen servants***, and ***gusts of wind***, and in numerous other ways.`,
                `I suggest you treat the effects of a ***warp marble*** as an individually targeted effect subject to magic resistance (see the ***Player's Handbook***, page 102, or the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 67).`,
                `Since the extradimensional space created by a ***warp marble*** is fragile enough to be disturbed by ***teleportation*** and similar effects, I suggest that ***dispel magic*** can free a creature trapped inside, or expel a creature trapped voluntarily, if the spell succeeds (see the next question).`

            question: `How do you decide if a magical item resists a ***dispel magic*** spell? A ***rod of cancellation***? A ***Mordenkainen's disjunction*** spell? What modifiers apply?`,
            answer: [
                `According to the spell description (see the ***PHB***, pages 148 and 210), a ***dispel magic*** spell cast directly against an item automatically causes the item to cease functioning for 1d4 rounds *unless* the item is in a creature's possession; in that case, the creature is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to determine if the item ceases to work. I suggest you apply magical and racial bonuses to the save, but not dexterity bonuses. Most DMs define "possession" as holding, carrying, or using the item. For example, a mage riding a ***carpet of flying*** has possession of the carpet, but the same mage does not have possession if he rolls up the carpet and puts it on a table while studying spells. Note that ***dispel magic*** has no effect on a permanent magical item at all unless it is actually targeted on the item, and artifacts are always immune; however, spell-like effects produced by any item can be dispelled just as spells can be.`,
                `A ***rod of cancellation*** requires a successful melee to-hit roll before it can drain an item. If the rod's wielder scores a hit, use the table on page 152 of the ***DMG*** to determine if the item saves. Generally, no modifiers apply to this save except in extraordinary circumstances that the DM must adjudicate on a case-by-case basis. For example, a ***stone of good luck*** might affect the save, since losing a magical item is bad luck indeed (or perhaps good luck, if the item is *cursed*). Situational modifiers that affect the attacker, such as bad footing or reduced visibility, reduce the to-hit roll and do not improve the defender's chances. Likewise, circumstances that hinder the defender increase the to-hit roll and do not make the item more vulnerable once a hit is scored.`,
                `***Mordenkainen's disjunction*** automatically disenchants all magical items within 30' unless they are in a creature's possession. In that case, the creature makes one save vs. spells; if the save fails, all the creature's magical items are ***disjoined***.`

                `Generally, there is no effect at all, as a ship's SR depends on the type of helm it has and the spelljammer's level. A ***ring of wizardry*** does not actually boost the character's level. However, I don't see anything wrong with assuming that any spells cast prior to spelljamming are taken from the bonus spells provided by the ring first; this might allow the character to remain "fresh" and be entitled to his full SR even after casting some spells.

Only fresh writing implements can be used to create scrolls; once a quill or printing plate is used to create a scroll, the residual magical energies remaining on it will spoil all future attempts (see the ***DMG***, page 86). Furthermore, inscribing a spell onto a scroll requires the creator to know the spell (if he's a wizard, that means having it in his spell books) and to expend the appropriate material component and suffer any normal penalties (such as unnatural aging) associated with the spell. While this latter requirement is not mentioned on page 86, it is implied on page 145 (see "Casting Scroll Effects"); it also is necessary for game balance, as PCs otherwise would avoid paying for expensive material components and avoid nasty side effects by writing scrolls instead of casting spells directly.`,

                `As TSR's Andria Hayday recently pointed out to me during a discussion concerning the ***AD&D® Trivia Game***, a "malfunction" does not have to be a total failure. Still, I think the spirit of this rule (see the ***PHB***, page 21) is to subject dwarves to occasional complete but benign magical-item failures. I suggest that any partial failure still render the item completely ineffective; the ***AD&D Trivia Game*** uses a ***ring of invisibility*** that makes a dwarfs legs disappear as an example. Likewise, a dwarf who has a ***broom of flying*** fail should not be able to limp away a slow flying speed. On the other hand, malfunctions probably should not actually cause harm; a malfunctioning ***ring of invisibility*** shouldn't partially disintegrate a dwarf, and a ***broom of flying*** shouldn't eject a dwarf while in the air or beat him the way a ***broom of animated attack*** does.

            question: `In "Sage Advice" in issue #156, you said a heavy catapult and a trebuchet were two different things. However, the SPELLJAMMER™ boxed set's ***Concordance of Arcane Space*** (page 40) says that a heavy catapult is a trebuchet. Also, if trebuchets can hurl rocks weighting 500 lbs., how can they be fitted onto spelljammers? If a trebuchet is a separate item, how much does it cost? How big would a ship have to be to have one? What are this weapon's other statistics?`,
            answer: [
                `I didn't actually say that catapults and trebuchets were different in issue 156, but they are according to the histories I've read. Technically, a catapult is a torsion-powered siege engine. A catapult's torsion (twisting or springing) power was usually provided by either tightly wrapped skeins of horsehair or layers of green boards arranged like the leaf springs on an automobile's suspension.`,
                `To get an idea of how a twisted-skein catapult worked, stretch a rubber band between your thumb and forefinger. Now take a *capped* ballpoint pen or unsharpened pencil and stick it between the two strands of rubber. If you flip the pen end over end a few times like an airplane propeller, you'll twist and tighten the rubber band; you'll have to slide the pen in and out a bit (because your hand will be in the way) to rotate the pen fully. When you've got the rubber band really tight (and aimed away from your face), let go. The rubber band will flip the pen over quite forcefully. The catapult's skeins were tightened by men on either side of the catapult who turned cranks connected to the skeins, tightening them up without moving the catapult arm, which was held back. Once the arm was released, the torsion in the twisted skeins flung the arm in an arc that was stopped by a crosspiece on the machine itself; the ammunition, which had been placed in a cup on the end of the arm, was then hurled away.`,
                `The leaf-spring catapult worked just like a big crossbow. In fact, the only difference between this kind of siege engine and a ballista (which worked exactly like a big crossbow) was that a catapult had a long arm with a cup or pouch at one end for throwing stones in a high arc; in place of the arm, a ballista had a slide that hurled a rock or large bolt in a flat arc.`,
                `A trebuchet, however, was powered by a counterweight. A long beam was placed on a pivot, with one end of the beam a lot closer to the pivot than the other. A heavy weight was hung at the beam's short end, and a pouch for holding rocks was hung on the other, then tied down; the whole weight of the short end was always far greater than the entire weight of the long end and its ammunition. When a loaded trebuchet was fired by releasing the long end, the weight snapped the long end upward, and the rock in the pouch was hurled away. If you've ever seen a troupe of acrobats working with a seesaw, you've got the idea.`,
                `In historical terms, the SPELLJAMMER setting's light catapult probably is similar to the historical onager, a small twisted-skein torsion engine that hurled a rock that weighed about 10 lbs. The medium catapult probably is similar to a larger skeinor leaf-spring torsion engine that hurled a 25-lb. rock (in landsman's terms, this would be a heavy catapult; the SPELLJAMMER setting has adopted its own terminology). The spacefarers heavy catapult, or "trebuchet," would be a very large torsion engine hurling a 40- or 50-lb. rock; page 40 of the ***Concordance*** defines catapults as "large, stone-throwing devices operated by springs, cranks, or flywheels." I doubt that very large counterweight engines could be used on spelljammers at all, except on dwarven citadels and other massive bodies of 300 tons or more. If you want to introduce such weapons into your campaign, you're on your own.`,
                `As a general rule of thumb, I suggest that doubling the weight of the missile should increase the hull damage to the next higher step. For example, a weapon hurling an 80-lb. rock would do 2d6 hull points. Each increment of increased damage should cost an extra 300-400 gp, reduce the THAC0 by one (20 maximum), take one extra crew, reduce the rate of fire by one, and increase the weapon's "count" by one. So, our "80-pounder" would cost 1,300-1,400 gp, require five or six crewmen, have a THAC0 of 19, have a rate of fire of 1/3 or 1/4, and would count as three large weapons installed. I suggest that you do not allow the critical-hit numbers and crew-damage ratings to increase beyond the heavy catapult's 18-20 and 3d10 values.`

            question: `I have a 6"-tall dual-classed fighter-monk. When he was a fighter, he was permanently ***hasted***, then he was shrunk. To make up for his limited choice of weapons due to his size, I made him a monk. At 5th level, ***haste*** and ***slow*** spells don't affect monks. Since the character was ***hasted*** as a fighter, will the effect remain? If so, will ***boots of speed*** improve his movement rate, if he can find a pair that will fit?`,
            answer: [
                `If you think a 6"-tall character can't do much damage with a fighter's traditional weapons, you're right—especially if he fights any foe larger than a cockroach. However, diminutive swords, battle axes, and the like still do more damage than tiny fists and feet. (I suppose a 6" monk wearing a ***girdle of giant strength*** might be able to do some interesting things with judo throws; a cartoon character called Atom Ant comes to mind.)`,
                `Strictly speaking, the ***haste*** effect ends as soon as the character becomes a 5th-level monk; the discipline and control the monk imposes on his body forces it to return to its normal (non-***hasted*** or non-***slowed***) state. Also, most campaigns disallow permanent ***haste*** effects, as they tend to unbalance play. Furthermore, this combination tends to burn out characters, as it magically ages the character in either edition of the AD&D game. In the original game, a ***haste*** recipient not only ages a year, but also must make a *system shock* roll or perish. In either edition of the game, I recommend that the permanently ***hasted*** character reroll for system shock periodically, like every day, week, or month; a character's body can take only so much abuse. Note also that the character should age at least twice the normal rate, and the DM would not be out of line to rule that the character actually ages an extra year every hour, week, or month.`,
                `Generally speaking, similar magical effects are not cumulative in either edition of the AD&D game. A second ***haste*** spell will not affect a ***hasted*** character in either edition, nor can a ***hasted*** character benefit from a ***potion of speed***. Likewise, ***boots of speed*** bestow a base movement rate (subject to encumbrance penalties) of 24. If the wearer already moves that fast or faster, he gets no benefit from the boots no matter where the superior movement rate comes from.

If a human was ***polymorphed*** into a bunny and some of the bunny's fur was taken, then the bunny was ***polymorphed*** back into a human, would the fur sample turn back into human hair or would it stay bunny fur? In other words, will a ***lightning bolt*** spell blow up in my wizard's face if he uses the bunny fur as a material component?`,
            answer: [
                `First, in either edition of the AD&D game, the tarrasque is a unique creature. A DM can decide that a whole race of tarrasques populates the world, but there are more original ways to challenge player characters. Second, ***shape change*** works only on the caster/user, so no one can use it like a ***polymorph other*** spell; if ***shape change*** could be used on creatures other than the caster, it would give the recipient the ability to change its shape and all such changes would be under the recipient's control, not the caster's, I'm not sure what form a tarrasque would choose if it could ***shape change*** itself, but it wouldn't be likely to bring any joy to the spell-caster, whatever that shape happened to be.`,
                `Of course, even a tarrasque might fall victim to a ***polymorph other*** or ***polymorph any object*** spell. In either edition of the AD&D game and in the D&D game, a ***polymorphed*** creature keeps its hit points, natural armor class, and possibly other purely physical abilities; in the tarrasque's case this includes regeneration and maybe even its limb-severing bite. So, your tarrasque/bunny still is one tough customer: A 300-hp bunny with AC -3, at least two attacks (bite and kick), and a legendary regeneration ability. Even if one managed to eat this creature, you'd still need a ***wish*** to keep it dead (see the tarrasque's description in the ***Monstrous Compendium***, volume 2).`,
                `Since ***polymorphed*** creatures assume their normal shape when killed, I suggest that any pieces cut from them change back, too. After all, being separated from the rest of the creature is a "death" of a sort. In the case of the tarrasque/bunny, the creature would change back when reduced to -30 hp, or perhaps any time after being reduced to below zero hit points if the DM so decides. This method clears up esoteric questions such as, "Can I use ***polymorphed*** human hair as a material component for a ***lightning bolt*** spell?" It also keeps player characters from using ***polymorph*** magic as a cheap shortcut when creating scrolls, potions, and other magical items.`

There's no reason to assume that the character cannot simply adapt and go on performing just as before. If the DM isn't feeling this generous, I suggest a penalty of 5-25 on all applicable percentile thieving abilities. For example, the one-handed thief mentioned above will suffer no penalties to his ability to hear noise, move silently, or hide in shadows, as he doesn't need to use his arms and hands to do these things. The character might suffer a penalty to pick pockets or find and remove traps. The DM could decide that this one-handed character has fewer options when picking pockets, and he could assess a -5 penalty to his percentile chance for success. The DM also might decide that rogues don't use their hands much when finding traps, but that two hands are helpful when removing traps, and so assigns no penalty to "find" and a -10 to "remove." Finally, the DM might decide to assign a -15 penalty to climb walls, since the character's remaining three appendages are going to be very busy when the character is climbing. If penalties are assessed, I strongly suggest that the DM give the character an opportunity to acquire some adaptive equipment and a chance to practice using it. The easiest way to simulate this is to use the "Training" optional rule (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 49).`,
                `As to the loss of weight, the character should lose about 4% of his total weight (4.6 lbs., in this case) for losing roughly half an arm. "Sage Advice" discussed this calculation in issue #156 (see the "legless gnome" question).`

            question: `Exactly how many gnomes can an adult griffon carry without losing its speed or altitude, physical attacks or fearsome temperament?`,
            answer: [
                `A typical gnome, without equipment, weighs about 82.5 lbs., but this figure can be as little as 73 lbs. or as much as 92 lbs. (***Player's Handbook***, page 24, Table 10). Carrying capacities for most flying creatures that can be used as mounts are conspicuous by their absence from the creatures' descriptions in the various ***Monstrous Compendium*** volumes. For the sake of game balance, I suggest that the most common flying mounts—pegasi, griffons, and hippogriffs—have the same carrying capacity. The Pegasus description in MC1 lists this as the same as a medium war horse: 220 lbs. at full speed, 330 lbs. at half speed, and 440 lbs. at one-third speed. As a general rule, a flying mount loses one maneuverability class when carrying a rider. I suggest that a winged mount loaded to the one-third movement class be unable to fly at all. Note that there is no reason a DM could not apply the movement rate and carrying capacity modifiers from the horse quality rules (***DMG***, pages 36-37) to flying mounts, too.`,
                `As to the question of a loaded griffon's temperament: Griffons are infamous for their nasty dispositions, and carrying loads doesn't make them any happier. Except for reductions to its maneuverability and movement, a griffon carrying a load still can fight normally. However, I suspect a griffon would strongly resent carrying multiple riders or being overloaded. Such a beast probably will try to shed—or even eat—excess riders.`

            question: `Where can a wizard put a ***sphere of annihilation*** when he is not using it?`,
            answer: [
                `You can "put" a ***sphere of annihilation*** anywhere you want when you are not using it, just by commanding it to stop. Of course, somebody else could set it in motion again by trying to control it, so it behooves the owner to park his ***sphere of annihilation*** in a safe place, like a locked vault. (For an example of a creative use of a ***sphere of annihilation*** stored in this way, see "The Living City" in POLYHEDRON™ Newszine issue #52.)`,
                `Since the effect a ***sphere of annihilation*** will have on its surroundings can vary widely from campaign to campaign, it might be useful to discuss this item's properties in some detail. Simply put, a ***sphere of annihilation*** is a hole in the fabric of the multiverse. Like other holes, a ***sphere of annihilation*** is benign until something falls into it.`,
                `However, the strictest possible interpretation of a sphere's powers (***DMG***, page 180) yields a pretty terrifying point. Since anything that contacts the sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed, a ***sphere of annihilation*** moving through the air might be accompanied by a continuous rumble of thunder as the air it encounters is annihilated and more air rushes in to fill the vacuum. Even at rest, a ***sphere of annihilation*** might eventually strip a planet of its atmosphere as it annihilates each and every gas molecule that touches it. A single such sphere could drain oceans and maybe even gobble up stars and planets; if one does not place a size limit on what the sphere can annihilate, it could suck in the whole earth instantly just by touching the ground. The only way to safely store a sphere under these conditions would be to seal it into an airtight vault, where it eventually would annihilate the air around it and create a perfect vacuum. Nevertheless, a more responsible approach would be to destroy the sphere with a ***rod of cancellation*** as quickly as possible.`,
                `I think it's far more reasonable to assume that fluid matter, such as a body of water or an atmosphere, will tend to flow around the sphere rather than contacting it and being annihilated. Of course, air or water could be fanned or ladled into the sphere, where it would be annihilated. This effect is similar to what would happen if a ***portable hole*** was spread out on a sand beach. The hole displaces the sand without otherwise affecting it, and no sand falls into the hole unless it is pushed inside. I also suggest that a ***sphere of annihilation*** be unable to utterly destroy anything bigger than it is. If, for example, the character controlling the sphere plunges it into the earth or into a castle wall, the sphere bores a 2' hole instead of sucking the entire "object" into oblivion. Likewise, small, man-sized, and large creatures might survive touching a sphere unless they fall completely into it. (See the previous question on "amputee thief" for possible consequences of misadventures with ***spheres of annihilation***.) Tiny creatures probably don't have enough strength or mass to resist being sucked into a sphere if they are unfortunate enough to touch it.`

            question: `The paragraph in the ***PHB*** that describes the Artistic Ability nonweapon proficiency (page 57) says that the artistic character is "naturally accomplished in various forms of the arts." The description goes on to say that if the character fails a proficiency check, he "has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad." Being something of an artist myself, I can tell you that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think characters viewing the work should be the ones to make the proficiency check to determine if they can perceive some value in it. After all, if the character has natural talent, he would not waste time working on something inferior. In the case of an architect or engineer, I can see checking to see if the creative character produced a work with flaws, but in the case of a painter, sculptor, poet, or musician, what is good or bad should be relative to the individual or group sampling the work.`,
            answer: [
                `You're putting too much emphasis on the "naturally accomplished" phrase. The proficiency description's second sentence explains what being "natural accomplished" means: The character understands color, form, space, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. While these are the fundamental building blocks of artistic expression, not every character understands them to the same extent, and not every character can consistently translate this knowledge into a successful work of art. Everywhere, there are marginally talented authors and artists who believe they'd be famous if only the public could appreciate them, but that's putting the cart before the horse. When an artist botches the job and produces a piece of junk, it's the artist who has failed, not the viewer.`,
                `I suppose a DM could assume that abstract art has made its appearance in the world. While it is true that only people who understand the "language" of such art can fully appreciate it, the artist still must successfully apply his knowledge to create a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing work. In this case, the viewer might indeed have to make an ability check to understand the work, but this does not free the artist from his obligation to do a good job in the first place.`

            question: `I am so disgusted with all the good represented in the AD&D game. Why is there no place in any of the various worlds for evil characters? Even the RAVENLOFT™ setting doesn't really allow for evil player characters. The staff at TSR really needs to realize that the Demiplane of Dread is not the kind of place where paladins and their moms bring PCs glasses of cold milk and plates of warm brownies! The AD&D game's melodramatic theme has made me sick one too many times. Can we look forward to a change soon?`,
            answer: [
                `TSR's products assume the PCs will be the good guys, so you are mostly correct when you point out that there is no place in any of the published worlds for evil PCs. You're "almost" correct, because any AD&D game world needs evil nonplayer characters to provide threat and conflict for the PCs. Completely safe worlds are pretty boring, as you can't have heroic player characters without suitably nasty villains to oppose them.`,
                `I also assure you that nobody at TSR, Inc. believes that paladins in the RAVENLOFT setting have time to serve cookies and brownies. They're far too busy trying to keep the various lords from obliterating the innocent and snatching unsuspecting travelers off their home planes.`,
                `Your simplistic view of good people as superficial wimps is curiously similar to the attitude most 20th-century megalomaniacs have shown to the world. In the 1930s, the Fascists in Germany and Italy and the Militarists in Japan had exactly this view of the western democracies. By 1945, however, everybody understood just how tough those democracies really were.`,
                `The struggle between good and evil is what drives the AD&D game. It is possible for the PCs to be the bad guys; however, TSR products assume the PCs will be good for several reasons. First, the game's basic structure requires PCs to work together as a group; each character class has inherent strengths and weaknesses that make them very well prepared to handle some situations but unprepared to handle other kinds of problems. The only way to overcome these gaps in capability is to work with other characters who have different sets of skills. The staff at TSR knows from experience that it is much easier-and a lot more fun-to put together an effective party of good and neutral characters than to try and hold together a group of evil characters.`,
                `A party of good characters will share a commitment to a common moral or ethical precept. Evil characters, on the other hand, tend to be concerned with preserving themselves. This concept of self varies with the character's actual alignment. The self could be an entity free to do exactly what it wants regardless of the larger consequences (chaotic evil); it could be, an entity uniquely qualified to survive the rigors of existence (neutral evil); or it could be a part of a larger structure that defines all existence (lawful evil). Nonetheless, each character's primary motivation is essentially selfish.`,
                `Consequently, the types of bonds that hold these groups together are vastly different. Good guys depend on friendship, trust, and altruism to keep themselves going. This helps keep campaigns going, too, since each players share in the group's successes. Since role-playing is a social activity, it helps when all the players and their characters are at least civil to each other. Evil groups stay together mainly through intimidation and deceit. This tends to destroy campaigns because players get tired of being fooled or bullied. Success, if there is any at all, belongs only to the player who comes out on top in each session.`,
                `In the short term, both types of groups can get by; in the long term, good groups develop common goals and accomplish great things together. Evil groups stay focused on the short-term goal of survival and don't get anywhere. If you do manage to reach a point of equilibrium where a powerful evil PC can control the other PCs, you'll find that the other players quickly will lose interest—nobody likes to play the fool or the doormat for long. Also, players can keep their game feelings separated from their real feelings for only so long. Sooner or later, the hostilities that arise between evil characters are going to arise between the players, and good-bye campaign. The only way I know to avoid this when your PCs are evil is to structure your games like skirmish war games, not heroic quests. This is fine if skirmish war games are what you want to play. You certainly could play a long-term campaign in the RAVENLOFT setting where each evil PC controls his own domain. Again, this type game of will become a long-term political and military campaign, not a role-playing campaign.`,
                `In a role-playing campaign, good guys tend to make a lot more interesting characters than bad guys. Bad guys don't struggle with the larger issues, and they remain unconcerned with the ethical implications of what they're doing. As a result, the player has less to think about and just plain less to do if he has an evil character. Bad guys don't last as long as good guys. When the party gets lost in the wilderness and food runs out, a good party pools its resources and tries to figure out how to feed everybody; a group of starving bad guys eventually begins stealing each other's food or even goes to work deciding how best to eat each other. The party infighting that arises among evil characters also increase the PC mortality rate. Not only will evil characters occasionally kill each other, but they often will allow their comrades to die unnecessarily. Such losses impair the group's ability to withstand further adversity. Of course, an evil character can disingenuously choose to use others to help him survive; however, this parasitic approach doesn't work in a role-playing campaign. If the character doesn't succumb to greed and turn predatory, the PCs he's taking advantage of eventually will notice what's really happening. In real life, people trapped in an evil person's orbit might not be able to break free, but players in a game always can just quit (and they often do).`,
                `An AD&D campaign with good PCs doesn't have to be melodramatic. Characters, at least occasionally, should have to labor long and hard to conclude an adventure. Along the way, they can face a few thorny ethical problems and be forced to choose between unpleasant alternatives. If the action in your games is sappy, it's because there's not enough creative energy going into the storytelling, not because the PCs are good. Be very careful when considering evil PCs. Many DMs, especially younger ones, don't have a clear idea of what evil is and what being evil costs. Evil, by definition, is that which causes ruin, injury, or pain. The good and evil alignments in the AD&D game are not rival clubs or gangs. Good people stick together because they have a moral and ethical inclination to do so. Evil characters don't hang together. Unlike good characters, they don't have a common point of reference. They also don't have to observe proprieties or sacrifice their own desires for the sake of goodness. They pay for these privileges by losing the trust and confidence of their companions and the ability to trust others. To an evil being, everyone and everything is a potential enemy, even after a peaceable meeting.`,
                `Since good characters tend to promote healthy, long-running campaigns, and evil characters tend to break up gaming groups, you can expect TSR's products to continue casting the good guys at center stage. If you decide to ignore all of the foregoing and try evil PCs, I wish you luck. At worst, you'll give up the game in disgust. At best, you'll learn a little bit about what makes the game tick. Either way, you'll get an education.`

            answer: [
                `I'm not surprised that one of my colleagues gave that kind of answer to your friend over the phone. Too many players and DMs spend their time and energy worrying about getting the rules "right" and not nearly enough time on telling an entertaining story, presenting and responding to intellectual challenges, and creating believable characters that players care about. People who call TSR to settle local rules disputes deserve what they get. Like everything else in a well-run campaign, the DM and players can hurt the game by applying the rules too loosely or too stringently. Campaigns that ignore the rules quickly spin out of control; player characters get too much power or can't get enough power. Either case makes adventuring a futile exercise. Likewise, the DM and players cannot make intelligent game decisions unless they have some idea of what the results of some particular action will be. The rules are there as a tool for channeling the action in a creative and entertaining direction. On the other hand, the rules are supposed to promote play, not restrict it; a role-playing game is supposed to be a heroic adventure, not an exercise in legal argument.`,
                `Generally speaking, any rule is fine so long as it does not impede or disrupt play. When someone points out a different way of looking at the rules, the group ought to consider the following: Will doing things this way bring the game to a grinding halt? Does this new way of reading the rules grant a PC or monster a world-beating way to use a spell or bit of equipment? Is this particular choice of skills and equipment obviously superior to all other combinations of powers available in the game? Will this new rule place a PC or monster in the kind of ridiculous position that only a complete fool would get into? If the answer to any of these questions is "yes," consider another interpretation of the rules, at least until the current adventure is over.`

A secondary weapon gives a character exactly *one* extra attack each round. Multiple attacks from level or specialization apply only to the primary weapon. Of course, a haste spell and similar magicks do grant double the normal number of attacks.

            question: `I have a player who's constantly after me to allow his character to acquire a chemistry or alchemy proficiency. This seems pretty high-brow to me, especially on a planet where a magnifying glass is regarded as a mysterious type of magic. What would a chemistry or alchemy proficiency do on an AD&D game world, anyway?`,
            answer: [
                `Generally, Athasians are a pretty sharp lot. While the introductory tale "A Little Knowledge" (by Jerry Oltion) includes a character who is mystified by a chunk of glass, this is far from the norm. As Tim Brown (Lake Geneva's DARK SUN world martinet) points out, most Athasians, with their exposure to elemental priestly magic and their survival skills, have more knowledge about the way their world works than common folk in most places.`,
                `Still, exact sciences such as chemistry are all but unknown in the magical worlds of the AD&D game. Chemistry is replaced by alchemy, which is a complex and esoteric art that is much better suited to sages (***Dungeon Master's Guide***, pages 106-108) than to adventurers who spend their time and intellectual energy learning character-class abilities. In any case, alchemy is too complex to be covered in a single proficiency. I suppose a true alchemist might have nonweapon proficiencies in Brewing, Astrology, Herbalism, Mineralogy, Spellcraft, Engineering, and, optionally, Pottery or Glassblowing (a previously undescribed proficiency). The character would have to use his combined knowledge of all these subjects to tackle any particular problem.`

            answer: [
                `No character who successfully uses the Water Find proficiency suffers a constitution loss due to dehydration (*Rules Book*, page 46). This does not necessarily mean that the character actually finds his full daily requirement of water, which varies according to the character's race, armor, and level of activity. In fact, since Water Find does not allow a character to rehydrate, it's pretty clear that the character usually finds something less than a full day's supply. As for giving away any water found, there's no reason to assume the character actually finds drinkable water; the proficiency might yield just a trickle of liquid water and several mouthfuls of soggy cactus pulp. While half-giants and thri-kreen might be able to choke down many different forms of nonliquid water, not every character can. I suggest that you place some limit on the amount of water actually available for sharing, say 1d4 + 1 pints. Note also that thri-kreen usually have better things to do with their nonweapon proficiency slots that spend them on Water Find, since they need so little water (DARK SUN *Rules Book*, page 86).`,

For example, a character with the wild talent of Domination gets 27 PSPs for that power (3 PSPs is the minimum cost to use the power once, plus the minimum maintenance cost of 6 PSPs, times four). If the character has more than one power, he gets the full allotment of PSPs for *each* power. That is, determine how many PSPs the character would get for each power, then add them together to get the character's actual PSP total.

            answer: [
                `A roll of 20 is always a failure when using a psionic power (***TCPH***, page 11), and it might also carry other penalties.

                `I'll admit that there's a bit of a semantic trap in the rules governing the shifting alignments of half-giants. While half-giants truly must choose an alignment each morning, they are free to "choose" the same alignment they have been following. A change in alignment is optional and occurs only when the DM and the player agree that the prevailing circumstances make it possible. In other words, a player with a half-giant character should consider what has happened to the character each day and decide if the character's alignment should shift. If, for example, the predominately good party the character has been adventuring with falls into a squabble over water or treasure, the DM and the player might decide it's time to shift the half-giant's alignment toward the chaotic or evil end of the spectrum. Remember, half-giants are inveterate imitators; they follow where their companions and neighbors lead, but their alignments don't shift without reason.`,

Once these tyrants realize what spelljamming is and what it can do, they're going to ruthlessly attack, not giving up until the spacefarers flee the planet or are killed or enslaved.

                `Judging from the description in the 1st Edition ***DMG***, I'm inclined to think that a ***rope of entanglement*** prevents its victims from moving normally (i.e., no walking, running, jumping, burrowing, or flying with wings) but does not prevent magical movement such as ***levitation*** or ***fly*** spells. Humans and demihumans who use their limbs to swim are immobilized and will sink if ensnared in the rope; however, fish and similar creatures probably still could swim through open water at half or two-thirds speed, as their streamlined bodies and tiny fins really can't be effectively tangled. On the other hand, even a fish or ***levitating*** creature can be held in place if there are weeds or other suitable objects the rope can grab along with the victim. For example, a wizard flying through a forest might be immobilized when the rope wraps him up along with the branches of an oak tree.`,
                `For purposes of game balance, I suggest that a creature entwined in a ***rope of entanglement*** be allowed to make melee attacks at a -4 penalty, but only against the rope or opponents who are directly adjacent to the entwined victim. Missile attacks are generally not possible while entwined, but the DM might allow them under special circumstances; a manticore's tail spikes might still be effective, for example, as might a giant porcupine's quills. An entwined victim might manage to fire a loaded and cocked crossbow that was already pointed at a target when the rope struck. Such attacks also should suffer the same -4 penalty to attack rolls that melee attacks get.`,
                `In any case, no attack rolls are required to use this item. The wielder can direct the rope at any opponent within range (20' horizontally and 10' vertically). The targets are automatically entwined in the rope, with no saving throw allowed, provided they fit within the size limits specified in the item's description. Common sense suggests that the rope's "downward' range (the distance within which it can be used if it is dropped from a height) could be more than 10', but probably not more than 20'.`,
                `Common sense also suggests that the rope cannot affect creatures in a total area more than about 40' long by 5' deep (this is the distance a line of eight man-sized creatures will occupy if they line up shoulder-to-shoulder with enough space between to allow for normal melee). In other words, the rope's maximum area of effect is 200 square feet, and its maximum "length of effect" 40'. Note that I'm assuming a ***rope of entanglement*** is 50' long, as this is the "standard" length for a rope in the AD&D game and it seems to jive with the rope's basic "capacity" of eight man-sized creatures (the "missing" 10' of the rope's length is used up as it coils around its victims).`

            question: `Please clarify the effects of magic resistance in the following situations: 1) Someone casts a ***wall of stone*** spell so that it falls on top of the magic-resistant creature; 2) A drow (an elven race that has magic resistance and suffers various penalties in bright light) is enveloped in a ***light*** or ***continual light*** spell; and 3) A magic-resistant marine creature that breathes only water finds itself within an ***airy water*** spell.`,
            answer: [
                `"Sage Advice" discussed magic resistance in issue #175 (page 76), but it seems to be time to study the subject in more detail. Most of these answers are pretty straightforward; a little common sense and a careful rereading of the magic-resistance rules (***PH***, pages 102-103; ***DMG***, page 66-67) should put these matters to rest. When adjudicating the effects, if any, of magic resistance, the DM has to consider two factors. First, what type of magic is involved? The rules make four distinctions: individually targeted spells, area-effect spells, in-place spells, and permanent spells. Second, does the "incoming" magic directly affect the magic-resistant creature, or is the effect on the creature merely a consequence of the magic being there? Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules (beyond what's already printed in the books) to decide which conditions apply. Here's my reasoning:`,
                `1) A ***wall of stone*** is a permanent magical effect (its duration is so listed in the spell description). Furthermore, magical "wall" spells are evocations, which directly bring forth or create their effects. When the ***wall of stone*** falls on top of a magic-resistant creature, or even if the creature tries to walk through a stationary wall, the magical effect is acting directly on the creature. Magic resistance applies; if the magic-resistance roll succeeds, the creature passes harmlessly through the wall. Since the ***wall of stone*** is permanent, there is no effect on it; that is, the wall is not dispelled or pierced with a hole that other creatures can pass through.`,
                `2) ***Light*** and ***continual light*** spells are a little harder to figure out. Both are in-place effects, operating continuously in a particular place or on a particular item. However, ***continual light*** also is permanent, and both spells can be cast directly against a creature to blind it. When used to blind a creature, either of these spells is treated as an individually targeted effect, and magic-resistance applies. Since the caster is targeting a single creature only when trying to blind an opponent with either spell, the effect is completely negated if the magic-resistance roll succeeds (as it is for any area-effect spell targeted solely at the magic-resistant creature).`,
                `However, an entirely different set of circumstances prevails when a magic-resistant creature moves into or otherwise finds itself inside either spells area of effect. Both spells are alterations, magic that works a change on a creature, area, or object, and this change produces the spells effects. In the case of ***light*** and ***continual light***, these spells change an area or object so that it emits light. One explanation of how this works is that the atoms in the area of effect are excited so that they emit visible light. The light has a central focus (so the light can be hidden by an opaque container), but it is the target object or area that emits the light, not the spell. Since the magic affects the area and not the creature, magic resistance does not apply (the light is a consequence of the spell). The same holds true for the reverse of these spells; a creature might be very badly affected by ***darkness*** or ***continual darkness***, but, since the magic doesn't directly affect the creature, magic resistance is irrelevant.`,
                `3. ***Airy water*** also is an in-place spell, but it is also an alteration that affects an area, not the creatures within the area.`,

            question: `In issue #169, you said a fighter/thief must use his thief
            THAC0 and cannot get specialization bonuses when backstabbing. But the ***PH***, page 45 says: "A multi-classed warrior can use all of his abilities without restriction. The warrior abilities form the base for other character classes." Page 45 also says multiclassed characters can combine class abilities, in direct contradiction to what "Sage Advice" said in issue #169. Did you make a brainographical error (to quote game designer Aaron Allston) or are you playing the "Skip's AD&D" game, in which DM interpretations override rules? If so, my friends and I will ignore your column in the future and ask DRAGON Magazine to run a disclaimer stating that your column does not follow the books.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding "combining" multi-classed abilities: The word "combine," as used on page 45 of the ***PH***, is meant to convey the fact that the character can freely use his abilities during a single encounter or adventure without penalty, as opposed to dual-classed characters, who can suffer experience penalties if they fall back on their old class abilities too soon. It is not meant to convey that a multi-classed character can use abilities from two or more classes simultaneously.`,
                `Regarding fighter/thief backstabs: The TSR house ruling—not the "Skip" ruling—on this matter is that the character must use his thief THAC0. You have quoted page 45 accurately, but the rules contradict themselves here. Two of a fighter's most important "abilities" are unrestricted weapon and armor use, and these are severely curtailed in several multi-classed combinations: fighter/wizards are prohibited from wearing most metal armor, fighter/clerics can't use edged weapons, and fighter/thieves can't wear metal armor without reductions to thief abilities. This is hardly unrestricted use of fighter abilities. The TSR staff's concern here is for game balance. The thief's backstab ability can do pretty darn hefty damage, and generally it is best for the campaign if a backstab attempt fails once in awhile.`,
                `Still, the letter of the rules supports your view. So does game logic; if thieves carefully study anatomy and learn to place their attacks so as to inflict maximum damage, it stands to reason that fighter abilities might allow them to hit an opponent's "soft spots" more easily. This particular conundrum won't be officially cleared up until that far-off day when an AD&D 3rd Edition comes out. Until then, I suggest you either follow the advice given in issue #169 or allow fighter/thieves to use their fighter THAC0 when backstabbing, but only with the standard +2 rear attack bonus. For purposes of game balance, the +4 bonus and fighter THAC0 is just too tough a combination for the campaign's bad-guy NPCs to withstand. From the standpoint of game logic, the training in precise blows a thief learns while perfecting the backstab (a highly favorable situation for the attacker) overlaps the fighter's generally superior training in the use of weapons in all situations.`,

            question: `In issue #179, you said that ***magic missile*** was a spell attack, and that the only effect a ***cloak of displacement*** had on spell attacks is a saving throw bonus. Since ***magic missile*** has no save, you said, there is no effect. Well, the spell description says that the spell produces "missiles" and that the target must be seen or detected to be hit. A displaced creature is really somewhere other than where a viewer thinks it is. When a spell caster targets a displaced creature, he's really just aiming at empty air. The creature wearing the cloak is actually unseen, as the cloak creates a sort of ***mirror image*** that is some distance from the wearer's actual location. Since ***magic missile*** doesn't work on inanimate objects, it is wasted in this case.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding ***cloaks of displacement*** and ***magic missiles***: I stand by my answer in issue #179. A ***magic missile*** is a spell attack (the number of times the word "missile" appears in the spell description notwithstanding) that always hits, *displaced* target or no. A *displaced* creature is neither invisible nor replaced by an illusory double. The cloak distorts other creatures' visual perceptions of the wearer's location. A wizard may very well be "aiming at empty air" when casting ***magic missiles*** at a *displaced* creature, but the spell compensates for the error and hits anyway. The spell description does require that the caster see the target, and a *displaced* creature is still visible, even if the viewer isn't sure exactly where the creature is.`,
                `The situation is analogous to what happens when you look at an object underwater from above the surface. The physical refraction (bending) of light as it passes from air to water makes the object appear to be in a different place. In the case of a displaced creature, the margin of error is 1'-2'. In either case, the viewer sees the object. The visual distortion caused by a ***cloak of displacement*** does not make the cloaks wearer immune to spells. For example, ***charm person*** and ***charm monster*** spells also cannot affect objects, but when cast at a *displaced* creature these spells don't dissipate into "empty air." The *displaced* target gets a +2 saving-throw bonus but still is vulnerable to the spell cast at him.`,
                `As an aside, a colleague of mine at TSR also considered my reply on this question in issue #179, and his comment was that I was being too generous when I suggested that a ***cloak of displacement*** might grant a save against ***magic missiles***. In his view, a ***cloak of displacement*** has no effect on ***magic missiles*** at all. TSR's Jon Pickens did point out, however, that the cloaks saving-throw bonus would be cumulative with a ***scarab of protection***, which does grant a save vs. spells such as ***magic missile***, which normally allow no save.`,

            question: `In issue #180, you said *polymorphed* creatures keep their hit points, natural armor class, and possibly other purely physical abilities. This directly contradicts the ***polymorph other*** spell description, which clearly states that the creature gains the natural armor class and "purely physical" abilities of the assumed form. You also suggest that the tarrasque could keep the sharpness ability of its bite. While this is a magical ability, a bunny's skeletal structure is hardly the same as that of the *un-polymorphed* tarrasque. In short, the tarrasque would be a 300-hp bunny with the saving throws of a 70-HD monster, and that's all.`,
            answer: [
                `Regarding *polymorphing* the tarrasque into a bunny: The victim of a ***polymorph other*** spell is stuck with the natural armor class of the new form; I goofed on this one. Nevertheless, the tarrasque is legendarily tough and keeps its armor class even when *polymorphed* into a bunny, amoeba, or anything else that doesn't have an armor class better than -3. The point I was trying to make in issue #180 is that the tarrasque is a near-deity-class creature that is all but invulnerable in any form. Note that regeneration is not dependent on a creature's outer form and *any* naturally regenerating creature—whether a tarrasque, troll, vampire, or whatever—still regenerates when *polymorphed*. Other forms of the tarrasque's special defenses-including immunity to heat and fire, and returning to life unless reduced to -30 hp and ***wished*** dead, remain when it is in bunny form. However, I forgot to mention in issue #180 that the tarrasque's ability to reflect beams and rays specifically depends on the creature's carapace, and this ability disappears if the creature is in "bunny form."`,
                `Regarding the tarrasque's ***teeth of sharpness***: There are two things you obviously haven't seen: the size and sharpness of a large rabbit's front incisors, which can do nasty things to errant fingers, and the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, in which a vorpal bunny wreaks havoc on King Arthur and his knights. The movie isn't part of the game, but I couldn't help thinking of the vorpal bunny scene when I was writing the column. You have a good point in that bunny teeth really aren't the limb-severing type. Still, the tarrasque is a power unto itself. I encourage DMs to ride herd on any group of PCs foolish enough to tackle the tarrasque, and limb-severing tarrasque/bunny bites are fine with me so long as they are fine with the DM.`,

What happens when the caster wants to change a ***projected image's*** relation to himself? In other words, if the image is facing in the same direction as the caster, what does the caster have to do to make the image face to his left? What happens to the image after the relationship shifts?`,
            answer: [
                `The text in the spell description (***Player's Handbook***, pages 180-181) does say that the image duplicates all the caster's actions, including spell-casting. That doesn't really make the spell's effect on spell-casting very clear, but the spells description in the 1st Edition ***PH*** (page 85) includes this line: "A special channel exists between the image of the magic-user and the actual magic-user, so spells cast actually originate from the image." I dont' think the 2nd Edition team left out that line to strip the ***project image*** spell of this property. As people on the GEnie computer network have pointed out, the spell does very little to deserve its sixth-level power ranking without this ability.`,
                `Running the spell this way does, however, force the DM™ to consider what happens to touch-delivered spells and spells that affect only the caster. I suggest that touch-delivered spells originate at the image, which the caster can then use to "attack" targets within his own movement limits. I also suggest that all spells with a purely personal effect (range 0, or area of effect limited to the caster) take effect only upon the caster; assume that such effects stay with the caster and don't "flow" through the channel. Note that ***project image*** extends a spell's range only indirectly by virtue of the fact that most spells originate from the image and not from the caster. Likewise, clever casters might use ***project image*** to cast spells around corners or into areas where they'd rather not be.`,
                `The caster is free to change the image's facing relative to himself just by concentrating for one round, which limits the caster to half movement and no attacks.

Raw reflexes can affect surprise, but their only effect on combat is to adjust armor class. The AD&D game's one-minute combat rounds make individual quickness much less important than the character's defensive value and general class of actions; that's why things like weapon speed factors and spell-casting times do affect initiative. Of course, DMs are free to add their own house rules incorporating reaction modifiers. The simplest way is to just subtract the modifier from the die roll. If you do this, I strongly suggest the DM take a long look at the monsters that populate the campaign and assign a reaction modifiers to some of the quicker beasts; otherwise, the PCs are going to win initiative far too often.`,

This is not the same as falling or running an equivalent distance; the creature does not gain any velocity or kinetic energy, it appears at the other door just as if it used a ***teleport*** or ***dimension door*** spell to go from one door to the other.

However, you also are not allowed to have as many sciences or devotions in a discipline as you have in your primary discipline, and at 3rd level you only get two sciences. You can't just pick up Telekinesis alone, then add devotions later, because you must always have at least twice as many devotions in a discipline as you have sciences.

The wild talents do not affect the types of psionic powers the character can learn; they are locked away in a separate part of the character's mind, just like all the other class abilities the character has chosen to ignore for the moment.`,
                `As soon as the character's psionicist level exceeds his old character-class level, he theoretically has access to his old character abilities and wild talents. However, he also still must abide by all the restrictions of the psionicist class. The simplest way to handle this is just to assume that the character has a few rogue powers and a pool of PSPs to support them. Such powers would never count against the numerical limits on the psionicist's powers or be used as prerequisites for other powers. However, the DM might allow the character to integrate his wild talents into his list of psionicist powers. This should not be a problem if the character does not exceed the number of disciplines he normally is allowed, and if he does not exceed the number of different kinds of sciences and devotions he can have within those disciplines. That is, the character can have "bonus" sciences and devotions but not extra disciplines, and the total number of devotions and sciences he has in his primary discipline still sets a limit on the number of sciences and devotions he can have outside the primary discipline (the primary discipline is the first discipline chosen when the character is a 1st-level psionicist). Proper play balance requires that the character's total number of disciplines remain unchanged and that the ratio between powers inside and outside the primary discipline be maintained. The effects of lifting these limits would be something like letting wizards and priests choose their daily spells as they need them instead of studying or praying for them in advance.`,
                `The character should be able to make free use (for purposes of prerequisites, PSP expenditure, and otherwise) of any power that does not violate the limits. For example, a character with a Mind Bar wild talent could choose telepathy as his primary discipline and have free access to the power, since Mind Bar is a telepathic devotion. (The total number of devotions within a primary discipline is limited only by the psionicist's level. In this case, Mind Bar is a "bonus" power.) Powers that exceed the limits must remain separate; for example, a character whose primary discipline is psychometabolism might not have "room" for Mind Bar, since the number of nonpsychometabolic devotions he can have is limited to at least one less than the number of psychometabolic devotions he has. So long as the character has even one excess power, his wild talent PSPs can be expended only to establish and maintain wild talents (and PSPs gained from the character's psionicist level cannot be spent on such rogue powers). If the character has a power both as a wild talent and as a psionicist's power, he should be allowed to merge the two and gain a point on his power score. Likewise, if the character manages to fit all his wild talents into his limits, he should be allowed to add his wild-talent PSPs to his psionicist total. The easiest way for the character to do this would be to choose a primary discipline that includes his wild-talent powers.`

            question: `The text and illustrations in ***The Arms and Equipment Guide*** identify a morning star as a kind of club with a spiked head. I always thought a morning star was one or more balls attached to a short handle by a chain or chains, but ***The Arms and Equipment Guide*** describes that kind of weapon as a flail. Also, where is the mace entry on the Master Weapons Chart?`,
            answer: [
                `In both versions of the AD&D game, a morning star is a big club with a spiked or ridged head, something like a hardwood baseball bat with a lot of large nails driven into the business end. That also is the definition given in every reputable treatise on medieval weapons I've ever read.`,
                `A flail, in the AD&D game and anywhere else where an accurate nomenclature of medieval weapons is used, is a weapon with the business end separated from the handle by a chain or other flexible joint. The ball, chain, and short-handle version is called a horseman's flail in the AD&D game. Another common form of flail is a long handle with a big club attached to the end by a very short length of chain; this is called a footman's flail in the ADD game. Flails of all kinds are the direct descendants of agricultural flails used to thresh grain; before the Industrial Revolution, the only way to separate grains of wheat, oats, rice, etc. from their stalks was to pile up the harvested plants and literally beat (thresh) them. The extra "snap" provided by the flails jointed head allowed the farmer to hit the pile of grain with more force and get the job done faster.`,
                `Both morning stars and flails were mainstays of the common folks weaponry because they were easy to make and use. No commoner—certainly no farmer—would ever mistake one for the other. I personally have never seen a flail improperly identified as a morning star in print, but I have met a lot of people who apparently have. I've also met people who confuse flails for maces, probably because they both can have round heads studded with spikes. If using an alternate nomenclature for medieval weapons makes you happy, fine, but when you're playing the AD&D game use the game nomenclature to avoid confusion.`,
                `[Webster's Third New International Dictionary *(Unabridged, 1986) describes a morning star as "a weapon consisting of a heavy ball set with spikes and either attached to a staff or suspended from one by a chain-called also holy-water sprinkler" (page 1471). "Holy water sprinkler" is used as an alternate name for the morning star in both the 1st Edition **PH** (page 37) and **AEG** (pages 82-83). Obviously, some confusion on this matter exists even among authorities. — Editor]*`,
                `[Don't depend on the dictionary for definitive information on game topics. Dictionaries and encyclopedias are fine places to start looking, but the people who compile them are unlikely to be experts on medieval weapons, and they certainly aren't experts on the AD&D game. — Sage]`,
                `The two forms of mace, horseman's and footman's, don't appear on the ***AEG's*** Master Weapons Chart (page 108). The typo monster strikes again. The statistics for the two types of maces presented in the ***PH***, page 68, are correct.`

            question: `In the RAVENLOFT® setting, will a paladin or good cleric lose his special class abilities if he fails a Ravenloft powers check? If a ***resurrection*** or ***raise dead*** spell fails and instead turns the target into an undead, would the spell-caster have to make a powers check? If so, why? Isn't casting one of these spells a good act? Is there any way to remove the stages and effects of failed powers checks?`,
            answer: [
                `First, take another look at the altered spell descriptions for ***raise dead*** (***Realm of Terror***, page 44) and ***resurrection*** (***RT***, page 45), and you'll find that each of these spells requires a powers check if they succeed or not. Bringing the dead back to life sends ripples through the Demi-plane of Dread. No matter what the spell-caster's intention, plucking a being out of the afterlife and returning him to the lands of the living is an event that the powers of Ravenloft always find interesting. It is true that powers checks are intended to start evil PCs down the road to ruin, but anyone who tampers with fate or with other basic forces in the multiverse while adventuring in Ravenloft takes the same risk.`,
                `When a character first fails a powers check, the powers of Ravenloft essentially invite the PC to become one of their own "part of the furniture," as TSR's Jon Pickens puts it. A stage-one failure is a subtle enticement that shouldn't give the PC any obvious clues about what's really going on. When paladin or cleric abilities disappear, the character is getting a strong clue that he's started down the wrong path. Also, as you point out, you can fail a powers check by doing things that would be considered good deeds anywhere else. Since powers checks are intended to punish players who wander off the straight-and-narrow path of heroic fantasy, play balance and overall campaign health dictates that the DM allow characters to redeem themselves once they've gone astray. For the moment, DMs are on their own when deciding how and when a character properly atones. However the upcoming ***Forbidden Lore*** boxed set, available in November and previewed in POLYHEDRON® Newszine issue #74, has extensive new material on powers checks.`,
                `Here are some suggestions until something better comes along: At the minimum, a character who wishes to reverse the results of a failed check should act scrupulously good. If the character has taken any special vows or represents a particular system of beliefs (a paladin, for example), his new behavior must absolutely embody the tenets of his sect or order. Furthermore, the character should avoid making use of the rewards and enticements a failed check brings. It might be hard to avoid using a +1 saving-throw bonus, but in such cases I suggest the DM allow it, especially if the character role-plays the attempt to give up the bonus ("Yeah, I know Bruce Bonecruncher gained a +1 bonus on fear checks after wrecking that altar, but he really looks long and hard at the swarm of killer bees just to be sure he has the gumption to stand up to them."). Of course, an ***atonement*** and a suitable quest should reduce or remove the effects of a failed powers check. So might a simple ***remove curse***, especially if the character has left the demi-plane or has spent some time actively resisting the powers. For a stage one failure, I suggest one month as the minimum period of atonement.`,

            answer: [
                `This is a design/editorial error, as the core rules for the AD&D 2nd Edition game don't list any monetary values for magical items. The upcoming ***Magical Encyclopedia*** does list a gold-piece value for just about every item ever created in the AD&D game (volume one, of two, will be available this fall). Gold-piece values, however, are even higher than experience values, and a starting witch probably could afford to "buy" only a single cursed item or a useful potion or two. This is because the witch is supposed to have an old item or two just left laying around from the old days, not so that she can have a leg up on everybody else in the magical-treasure department. As a rule of thumb, an item's monetary value is three to seven times its xp value (usually five times), and most cursed items usually are worth 100 gp (for potions) to 1,000 gp (for miscellaneous magic).`,

            answer: [
                `First, wild magic is not a school; it is a chaotic magical force and a method of studying magic that capitalizes on that chaos. As the ***TOM*** points out (page 5), wild mages are not true specialist wizards, but their unusual approach to magic gives them many of the same benefits that specialist wizards get.`,
                `As unpredictable as wild magic is, it still functions within the school framework. That is, wild-magic spells serve to alter, summon, block, etc. just like other spells in the game do. Note that priest spells aren't arranged into schools, either, but each spell still is assigned a school that helps define how and why it works. Various game mechanics that make use of spell schools work normally in regard to priest and wild-magic spells. For example, a ***detect magic*** spell can be used to determine a spell's school, which in turn reveals clues about what the spell is doing and how it might affect an adventure. Likewise, a specialist wizard who receives a bonus or penalty to saving throws against spells of a particular school gets that bonus or penalty even if the spell in question is a wild magic spell or priest spell.`,

            answer: [
                `The AD&D 2nd Edition game does use a ten-sided die for initiative and surprise. The "1-in-6" reference is an error.

I think the most sensible method is to have the character make the check immediately before any surprise roll. Another workable method would be to allow a character to check once every turn (10 minutes) or hour. The +1 bonus for a successful proficiency check would apply to all surprise rolls made within that time.`

"Sage Advice" just passed along the errata to you, the reader. If you reread the rules on punching, wrestling, and martial arts specialization in ***The Complete Fighter's Handbook***, you'll find that these "specializations" do not count as weapon specializations. Single-classed warriors are free to take as many of them as they have nonweapon proficiency slots to spend on them. Dual- or multiclassed warriors can choose one style specialization and one unarmed specialization: punching, wrestling, or martial arts, assuming they have the proficiency slots to spend on them. The terminology is confusing, but these four types of "specializations" are not weapon specializations, per se.`,

            question: `Page 12 of ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** says bards receive lesser penalties for wearing heavy armor because they are accustomed to wearing such armor while thieves are not. I must take exception to this. To my mind, multiclassed fighter/thieves are just as "accustomed" to heavy armor as are bards. The reduced penalties should apply to both types of characters or to neither. I would say to neither, since only dexterity should mitigate the noise, stiffness, and bulk of these types of armor and the ***PHB*** already allows for dexterity adjustments.`,
            answer: [
                `As "Sage Advice" has pointed out before, the Complete Handbooks contain *optional* rules for altering your campaign's scope and focus. Don't waste time taking exception to anything you find in them—just don't use the rules you dislike. As always, you'll have to use common sense when picking and choosing rules, but you never have to use all the rules in a "Complete Handbook!' I think you can still get pretty good use out of ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** even if you don't allow bards reduced penalties for wearing armor.`,
                `I think you've really opened a can of worms by suggesting that fighter/thieves might be entitled to the reduced armor penalties in the ***The Complete Bard's Handbook***, even if you immediately reject the idea yourself. I suppose that it isn't much of a leap to extend this benefit to multiclassed fighter/thieves once a DM decides his campaign's play balance isn't going to fly out the window if he allows bards the reduced penalties. Why stop at just multiclassed fighter/thieves? After all, dual-classed fighter/thieves know even more about armor and how to function when wearing it than any other kind of thief—they've had training as pure fighters. Then again, what about thief kits like the adventurer, bandit, bounty hunter, scout, and thug? Thieves with these kits—especially thugs-can expect combat and probably learn something about armor, too. There are two big reasons ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** suggests reduced thieving penalties for heavy armor.`,
                `First, bards in the AD&D 2nd Edition game are true dilettantes, jacks of all trades. This generalization goes beyond what multi- and dual-classed characters do. Bards don't learn a whole lot about anything, but they learn a little bit about everything, and this makes them intrinsically more adaptable than dual- or multi-classed characters.`,
                `Second, ***The Complete Bard's Handbook*** is specifically designed to give bards a boost. It's for DMs who want to run all-bard campaigns or at least want to encourage more players to choose bards. Many bard advocates complain, perhaps rightly, that the core rules for bards in the AD&D 2nd Edition game produce weak, unplayable characters. Certainly, a multi-classed fighter/thief has access to more thief skills and fighter weapons than a bard has. The fighter/thief probably also has a better THAC0 as well. Many people think that a bards few spells and special abilities hardly make up for all this. The reduced armor penalties attempt to redress this.`

I suggest you allow only psionicists to research new powers; characters with wild talents have insufficient knowledge even to attempt research. The psionicist needs a laboratory just as a wizard or priest does. The actual cost of developing a new power probably should range from 100 gp to 9,000 gp, just as it does for a spell, but the DM will have to set the cost. Beyond this, deciding what to accept as a new psionic power involves the same process of analysis and individual judgment that introducing a new spell does.`,

Likewise, the more "oomph" the power has, the worse (lower) its power score should be. Again, use other powers as a guideline.

                `A psionicist can maintain a previously initiated power no matter what else he does in a round, provided that he has the PSPs to pay the maintenance cost, and provided that the power in question can be maintained. Once a power is "switched on," maintaining that power does not require concentration and does not count as an action for the psionicist. Maintaining a power does not interfere with combat, spell-casting, initiating a new psionic power, or other activities. Of course, if the psionicist loses consciousness or dies, he cannot continue to maintain a power.`,
                `Spell-casting and initiating a new power are mutually exclusive—a character can do one or the other, not both, in a single round—except that the psionicist always can initiate a defense mode *and* use another psionic power or cast a spell.`,
                `Concentrating on a spell to extend its duration counts as an action. Psionic powers can be maintained while concentrating on a spell, but new powers cannot be initiated. Obviously, some maintained powers *do* require concentration as well as PSP expenditure. For example, the Telepathic devotion ESP allows the user to read minds. While the rules (***CPHB***, page 14) allow the power to be maintained without effort, common sense suggests that actually reading a mind would keep the psionicist occupied. If he does something else (such as launch an attack), he still can maintain the power but reads no thoughts that round.`,
                `It might be helpful to think of psionic powers that can be maintained as long-lasting or slow-acting effects. Powers such as Mind Over Body last a long time, just as a ***shield*** spell does; once activated, this power works on its own, so long as PSPs are expended to keep it running. Powers such as Molecular Manipulation are slow acting, like a ***heat metal*** spell; once initiated this power takes time before it finally works, but it requires nothing of the user except PSP expenditure.`

            question: `When a character fails a system-shock roll in a campaign that uses the "Hovering on Death's Door" optional rule (***DMG***, page 75), do his hit points fall to zero? Do they fall to -10? Or, do they fall somewhere between? What happens when a regenerating creature fails a system-shock roll? Do regenerating creatures have to make system-shock rolls? By the way, is regeneration a magical ability? Can an ***anti-magic shell*** cancel it?`,
            answer: [
                `System-shock failure means *death*, whatever that means in the campaign. If you use the "Deaths Door" optional rule, system shock failure places the victim at -10 hit points (or lower, at the DM's option).`,
                `Generally, only attacks that destroy all the cells in a creature's body (such as fire, acid, or disintegration) can prevent regeneration. While a regenerating creature is subject to system-shock rolls, regeneration will eventually rebuild the "shocked" system and restore the creature. A regenerating creature also eventually will recover from the effects of disease and poison. In all these cases, the DM should assign a hit-point value to the condition to see how long it takes the creature to regenerate back to full health and vigor.`,
                `"Natural" regeneration, such as that found in trolls, is not magical and is not subject to ***dispel magic*** or ***anti-magic shells***. It is, however, innate and independent of the creature's form. Magical regeneration, such as from a ***ring of regeneration***, is affected by ***dispel magic*** or ***anti-magic shells***. The DM will have to decide exactly what the results are when this happens. For example, a successful ***dispel magic*** can shut down an item like a ***ring of regeneration*** for 1d4 rounds. Since the ring restores one hit point every turn (10 rounds), the DM will have to decide what effect this interruption will have on the ring-bearing creature. The simplest solution is to delay the regenerated hit point until the ring actually has operated a full, uninterrupted 10 rounds.`

According to the ***DMG***, page 177, if the bag is placed inside the hole, a rift to the Astral plane is opened.

A clever party should be able to arrange things so that they pass through the rift or portal when it opens.

            question: `If two astral travelers from different Prime Material planes encounter a color pool (from ***The Manual of the Planes***) to an alternate Prime Material plane do they perceive it as the same color? If the color pool leads to one traveler's home plane, how does each character perceive it? A pool leading to a home plane would have the traveler's silver cord coming out of it, but what if there is no cord present? If a character arrived on the Astral plane via a rift created by a ***portable hole*** and a ***bag of holding***, what is the chance that there is a color pool nearby?`,
            answer: [
                `Judging from the material on pages 62 and 63 of the ***MP***, each astral color pool has a distinct color depending on where it leads. However, when a pool leads to a character's home Prime Material plane, it always looks silvery no matter what its "normal" color is. When two characters from different Prime Material planes view a pool leading to a third Prime Material plane, they both see the same color. If one traveler is from the pool's plane and the other is not, the first traveler sees a silver pool and the second traveler sees another color. This is true if there are silver cords present or not.`,
                `The DM must decide when and where color pools appear. Controlled magicks, such as ***astral spells***, always bring a character onto the Astral plane via a color pool. Uncontrolled entries into the Astral plane might not put travelers next to a pool, or they might place the travelers next to a pool that is rapidly shrinking, as might be the case when a rift created by a ***portable hole*** and a ***bag of holding*** opens and closes.

            question: `Most psionic powers have a preparation time of zero. When running a psionicist in a campaign that uses segments, wizards and priests use casting times that take segments, rounds, or turns. This means a psionicist can call upon multiple powers in a single round and destroy several PCs or monsters before anyone else can even blink. What limits are there on psionics in campaigns that use segments?`,
            answer: [
                `Even in the original AD&D game, the basic unit of time is the one-minute melee round, not the six-second segment. During one round, a character can take one basic action. Spell-casting times and weapon speed factors affect initiative—they do not allow for multiple actions. That is, a wizard cannot cast 10 one-segment spells, and a fighter cannot attack 10 times with a weapon that has a speed factor of one. Multiple actions or attacks are possible under a variety of different circumstances, but never just by virtue of the segment system.`,
                `If you are playing a variant game that uses segments instead of rounds, you're on your own. The easiest fix would be to assign all psionic powers a "casting time" of at least one segment and use whatever rules you've cooked up to govern spell-casting to govern psionic power use as well. Note that the AD&D 2nd Edition game dispenses with the concept of segments altogether. Even when using the most complex optional initiative rules, things like casting times equate to a simple initiative modifier, which was the real intent behind the original game's segment system in the first place.`

Although the rules are not completely clear on the point, the text on page 14 that details maintaining powers leads me to believe that any power that is maintained turn by turn or hour by hour requires PSP expenditure by the turn or hour rather than by the round. In these cases, the initial PSP expenditure keeps the power going for the first turn or hour. However, the DM™ is free to assume that the initial cost can sustain the power for only the first round, and can require that maintenance costs be paid starting the next round. The former interpretation requires fewer PSPs than the latter, but since maintenance costs by the turn or hour are fairly low, it doesn't make much difference which way you decide to do things as long you treat all powers the same way.`,

The only limitations on these powers are the PSPs available to the character and the power check, which gets more difficult as the distance to the location to be scryed increases. The DM should use some common sense when allowing the character to choose an area to be scryed. For example, the character cannot just declare he is eavesdropping on the wizard Drawmij's library unless he actually knows where that library is, either through personal knowledge or by making an educated guess. On the other hand, the character can monitor an area just by describing it in general terms. For example, the character can declare that he is scrying the spot exactly 10 miles to his west, or the topmost room in a tower he has seen.`,

                `If you follow the description to the letter, area of effect for Control Flames refers to the two-dimensional area covered by the fire's fuel. The mock fire elemental in your example would be possible only if the fuel covered 10 square feet or less and the flames were 24' high, which might be possible if there were some sort of forced draft fanning the fire. When faced with a very large fire, say a multifloor building aflame, the psionicist can control only the flames erupting from a 10-square foot area. Note that 10 square feet is not a very big area—it's 5' by 2' or 21⁄2' by 4', or some combination of dimensions that can be multiplied together to equal 10'. Compare this with a standard 10'x10' square on a dungeon map, which is 100 square feet.

                `An Inertial Barrier protects the user against disintegration from any source. The rules don't explain why, but here's my best guess: Disintegration destroys matter by setting up a vibration that causes objects and creatures to break into microscopic pieces and fly apart; an Inertial Barrier dampens the vibration and disrupts the effect.`,
                `The "missiles" created by a ***magic missile*** spells are purely magical and are not affected by Inertial Barriers. While an Inertial Barrier does not confer fire resistance, it can foil most fire-based attacks by keeping flames from reaching the user. That is, the user is protected against ***fireball*** spells, but still can get burned if he walks into a burning building or pool of molten lava. As explained in the devotion's description (see page 46), Inertial Barriers can be effective against *some* breath weapons, but not all. Breath weapons that are composed of pure heat, light, cold, electricity, or other forms of energy are not affected. Gas, acid, or flame breath weapons and any breath weapon that involves hurling or projecting some kind of matter are affected. When dealing with very powerful breath weapons, such as dragon breath weapons, I suggest that you allow the Inertial Barrier user to roll only the basic dice, not dice plus bonuses. For example, if an adult red dragon breathes through an Inertial Barrier, the defender rolls 12d10 vs. the dragon's 12d10+6. Assume that the plus represents the intrinsic power (heat, acidic potency, etc.) of what part of the breath does penetrate the Inertial Barrier.`

The DM might choose to impose a power-score penalty, since it might be difficult to focus one's inner energies with a nose and mouth full of quicksand; I suggest an additional -1 to -4. In this case, the character will simply bob to the surface of the water or quicksand, where he probably can swim or slither to safety. Actually regaining one's feet and walking on the surface after being submerged and popping up like a cork would require considerable luck and dexterity.`,
                `A falling character using Body Equilibrium certainly could use Control Wind to influence where he lands. However, it would be quite difficult to slow a fall or to lift a grounded character using Control Wind, as the character must have an updraft to lift him. This would be impossible in still air. If the character found a strong thermal—on a sunlit hillside, for example—he might be able to increase and control the naturally occurring updraft enough to lift him, then glide to a landing some distance away. Note that such a feat would require ideal conditions; the character probably would have to be outside during a sunny day and on terrain that can create rising currents of warm air—open fields, rocky areas, and the like. Bodies of water don't generate thermals at all, and forests create very weak ones. This feat might also be possible indoors in chimneys, ventilation shafts, and other places where there is a lot of rising air.`

Increasing the character's wisdom score also will increase the character's inherent potential (***CPH***, page 13). Generous referees will make such an increase retroactive. A ***wish*** also might allow a character to increase his total PSPs, from two to 10 points. A ***wish*** certainly could allow a character to "forget" one discipline, science, devotion, or defense mode and replace it with a power more to the character's liking. If ***wishes*** are very rare in your campaign, it also might allow a character to pick up an extra devotion either inside or outside the primary discipline, but I don't recommend that you allow characters to acquire extra sciences or disciplines this way. Likewise, it's probably okay to let characters ***wish*** for a wild talent, though stern referees will make such characters roll to test for wild talents when making the ***wish***. DMs who do this should feel free to chuckle evilly if the percentile roll is low enough to have revealed a wild talent without ***wishing*** and should feel free to apply the normal consequences if the roll is 97 or higher. I do not recommend that you allow characters with wild talents to ***wish*** for additional powers, but it should be okay to let them ***wish*** for more PSPs.`,
                `Of course, characters can attempt to exceed these limits, but when they do so the DM should either declare that the ***wish*** does not work, or should impose some sort of penalty on the character. "Okay, Hurd the Magnificent, you can have the Mass Domination science. Of course, you are now a 5th-level human psionicist, not a l0th-level elven wizard!"`,
                `As always, game-logic and game balance reasons exist for these limitations. From the standpoint of game logic, the mortal brain can harbor only so many psychic powers before it turns to mush. High-level psionicists can command a wide variety of powers only by virtue of long experience and training. In terms of game balance, ***wishes*** should be introduced into a campaign only to let the players make minor adjustments to their characters' fates. If the DM allows characters to use ***wishes*** to get cheap power, the challenge and fun of adventuring quickly wear off.`

Can the user turn into something fanciful such as an animated chair?`,
            answer: [
                `I suggest you treat Metamorphosis as a slightly altered version of the ***polymorph self*** spell (see ***PHB***, page 161); unlike a *polymorphing* spellcaster, the Metamorphosis user is limited to forms that have the same mass as his own body, and he must make a system shock roll when he changes form. However, the Metamorphosis user is not limited to the forms of creatures, and can maintain an assumed form so long as he has PSPs to maintain the power. The Metamorphosis user gets the assumed form's movement rate and armor class, along with its physical attacks. He does not get special abilities such as gaze weapons, breath weapons, weapon immunities, and so on. On the other hand, the character does gain certain vulnerabilities and immunities that are intrinsic to the assumed form. Common sense must rule here. For example, while a character Metamorphosed into a werewolf cannot shift shapes (and thus avoid further system shock rolls) and is not immune to normal weapons, a character Metamorphosed into a brick is immune to normal fire simply because bricks don't burn.`,
                `The power's description goes out of its way to say that the user can change into *anything*, so I'd be inclined to let PCs go wild when picking forms into which they can Metamorphose. Nevertheless, some limitations are in order, or PCs will abuse the power. I suggest that you assume that simple forms, such as bricks, have no senses except a faint sense of touch and pain. A character Metamorphosed into a brick cannot see, taste, hear, or smell. He can feel vibrations, however—even faint ones from a man-sized creature walking nearby—and he knows when somebody tries to break him. The DM could allow the character to turn into a brick with eyes, ears, and nose so the character could get more sensory input, but enemies will more easily spot the character. That character also will have some vulnerabilities a normal brick might not, such as susceptibility to ***stinking cloud*** spells and harpy songs. Likewise, a character Metamorphosed into a walking chair would have visible joints and muscles.`

If the Molecular Manipulation power check succeeds, the Body Weaponry user can feel the weakness in his arm. If the Body Weaponry user stops maintaining the power and allows the Body Weapon to change back into an arm, the weakness disappears because the arm is part of a creature—no longer an object and no longer subject to Molecular Manipulation. If a Body Weapon breaks—because of Molecular Manipulation or any other cause—the Body Weaponry user loses that chunk of body mass, as though the affected limb were severed. The broken piece immediately changes back to flesh (it is cut off from the flow of psychic power that kept it in weapon form), and the DM might rule that the Body Weaponry user must immediately drop the power, although there is no game-logic reason that he couldn't go on spending PSPs to maintain the broken stump. In any case, I don't recommend any spectacular or gory effects when the Body Weaponry user does drop the power—he should just have a healed-over stump. Any means that can restore a severed limb, such as a ***regeneration*** spell or magical items, can restore the lost limb.`,

You hold this contest in exactly the same way you hold any other psychic contest (see page 22), except that the victim uses his strength score and the attacker uses his power score.

Any item used in a Ballistic Attack inflicts 1d6 points of damage regardless of its "normal" damage rating; this is due to the tremendous velocity the devotion generates. I suppose a sheaf arrow used in a Ballistic Attack could do 1d8 points of damage if the DM so desires, but there's no guarantee the arrow will hit the target point first, so I suggest sticking with the standard 1d6. Using Telekinesis to wield a weapon is more like normal melee, and a hit inflicts the weapon's normal damage rating. Unless you allow items such as arrows and quarrels to be used as stabbing weapons in melee, I don't recommend you allow them to be used Telekinetically either. (I know some campaigns allow characters to make stabbing attacks with arrows when there's no other weapon available. A typical "house rule" governing such attacks sets the damage at 1d2 and the arrow usually breaks when it hits.)`,

Do such hit points always start at the maximum when the power is first activated?`,
            answer: [
                `Any ability bestowed onto the character by Animal Affinity is strictly temporary, and it completely disappears when the power is dropped or when the character chooses to assume a different animal attribute. If the character chooses to assume an animal's hit points, he in effect gets a whole new set of hit points that have nothing whatsoever to do with the hit points he has as a character. When he drops the power, his hit points immediately revert to whatever total the character had when he activated the power. If the character uses the power to assume animal hit points again, he immediately has whatever total his animalistic alter-ego had when he last used the power.`,

For playability, I suggest that "artificial" healing from first aid, magical items, healing spells, or psionics apply only to the hit-point total the character is presently using. That is, a ***cure light wounds*** spell cast on a character who is using an animal's hit points improves only the animal's hit point total. Since the unused hit point total cannot be damaged, it cannot be healed either. However, "natural" healing from rest should apply to both totals.

Since Expansion does not affect clothing or equipment (see page 60), it's clear to me that Reduction doesn't affect clothing or equipment either. If a Reduction user rolls a 20 on a power check, he should "pop" right out of his clothes. A DM might rule that the character suffers some damage in the process, say 1d4 to 1d8 points of damage. A strict DM will make the character roll item saving throws for anything the character was wearing; the magical fire category (see the item saving throw table in the ***DMG***, page 39) seems to offer the most reasonable set of numbers for making such saving throws.`,

If the DM rules that sleep isn't possible because the surroundings are too noisy or too uncomfortable, then no Dream Travel can take place. On the other hand, there is no reason to assume that characters who can make themselves somewhat comfortable and relaxed can't will themselves to drift off far enough to allow the power to work.

            question: `The statistics for character drag ons in ***Dragon Kings***, pages 37-39, don't match the summary information at the back of the book, nor does it match the description in the DARK SUN boxed set. Specifically, the summary information does not mention the psionic abilities listed on page 39—which give a 30th-level dragon 20 sciences and 35 devotions. Meanwhile, the boxed set gives the Dragon of Tyr a psionicist level of 20 (or 25, depending on which section you read), the ability to cast spells and use psionics simultaneously, and regeneration at 10 hp a round. Also, the hit-dice listings are widely different in all three places, and the burrowing movement rate of 6 listed in the boxed set is not mentioned in either section of ***Dragon Kings***. Finally, the footnote on the jumping movement rating in the supplement reads: "now has a 'jumping' movement rate of 5 (should be 6)". What does this mean? Is the jumping rate 5 or 6?`,
            answer: [
                `The mismatch within the ***Dragon Kings*** book is an editorial error. The text on dragons got changed in one section of the book, but not in the other—this kind of thing happens more often than anyone would like. Here are my unofficial suggestions for resolving the contradictions:`,
                `Use the psionic powers listed on page 39; this gives the Dragon of Tyr six disciplines, 20 sciences, 35 devotions, and five defense modes. Use the powers listed in the boxed set (see the "Monsters of Athas" section in the ***Wanderer's Journal***). Pick the additional 10 sciences and 11 devotions yourself, and assume that the powers listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal*** are the ones the Dragon uses the most. Note that the five defense modes listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal*** under the Telepathy discipline do not count toward the Dragon's total number of powers (see the ***Complete Psionics Handbook***, page 14).`,
                `Use the hit-dice listings from the supplement at the back of ***Dragon Kings***. This matches the table on page 37 at every level except 21, where the dragon should get +20d4, not + 10d4. Note that the Dragon of Tyr has nearly maximum hit points for a 30th-level dragon (250 out of a possible 254, assuming no Constitution bonuses).`,
                `The burrowing movement rate seems to have been dropped by mistake; I'd add it at 27th level.`,
                `The parenthetical note about increasing the jumping movement rate to 6 probably was an editor's note that accidentally found its way into the book. Since most movement rates in the AD&D® game are evenly divisible by three, somebody probably wanted the listing changed. I don't see any reason not to leave the jump rating at 5, which is how it is listed in the ***Wanderer's Journal***, but go ahead and increase it to 6 if it makes you happy.`,
                `The Dragon of Tyr's regeneration power and ability to use spells and psionics simultaneously are unique to it—it's a special beast, even as fully matured Athasian dragons go. The exact reasons this dragon is so special are unrevealed, but they might be uncovered in an upcoming DARK SUN game product or novel.`

Are the various effects of the avangion's aura cumulative or do the various powers replace each other? If they replace each other, can an advancing avangion opt to forego a higherlevel effect to keep a lower-level one? Do avangions have psionics?`,

                `Except for the hit-dice column, the summary section is correct.

Avangions of 28th level and above are immune to a dragon's physical attacks, since the equivalent of a +4 weapon is the limit for creatures.

This would seem essential for high-level avangions, who have no appendages.`,
            answer: [
                `The DM, of course, has the final say, but I suggest that any dragon that can fly be allowed to make snatches and plummets. Just apply the MC formulas to the ***Dragon Kings*** claw and bite ratings. Use the tail—attack ratings from ***Dragon Kings***. I'm inclined to think that Athasian dragons are not built in quite the same way as dragons are on other worlds, and I suggest that you disallow wing buffets. Likewise, I don't think Athasian dragons should kick.`,
                `Dragons and avangions use the same rules for spell-casting as other characters do, including casting times, and various components. It is unclear exactly how they accomplish this, especially in the case of high-level avangions. Note that while an advanced being can't launch spells any more quickly that any other spell-caster can, the DM should assume that they always have *some* way to complete any other requirements. Avangions, for example, can be assumed to flutter their wingtips to complete somatic components. Both dragons and avangions can be assumed to have some way to get at material components if that optional rule is in effect. Material components might be manipulated psionically, plucked from a pocket dimension, regurgitated from the gut, or whatever. Advanced beings are powerful enough to bend the rules a little bit when necessary.`,

            question: `The descriptions of two of the new psionic powers in ***Dragon Kings*** seem a little odd to me. The Teleport Object power on page 142 is listed as a Psychokinetic devotion, but shouldn't it be Psychoportive since it has Teleport as a prerequisite? Also, Return Flight on page 146 is listed as a Psychometabolic devotion, but wouldn't it be better as a Psychokinetic devotion?`,
            answer: [
                `Although it is not common for a power to have a prerequisite from another discipline, there are several precedents in the Metapsionic discipline. Teleport Object was placed in the Psychokinetic discipline because it involves manipulating objects; Psychoportation involves personal movement by the power's user. If that doesn't satisfy you, change the Teleport Object prerequisite to Telekinesis.`,
                `You have a better case with the Return Flight devotion. Since the user is manipulating an object, it sure seems to belong in the Psychokinetic discipline. I suspect it was placed within Psychometabolism to maintain game balance and because the user isn't just hurling objects around (as in the Ballistic Attack power); instead, he "programs" a missile to return to him if it misses. As such, it augments the user's ability in using missiles rather than granting the user a wholly new ability.`,

                `With something like 3,000,000 + AD&D game players out there, variety is a must. That's why TSR, Inc. cranks out so many game worlds. One or two of them might be allowed to retire gracefully, but each of them has a cadre of dedicated fans who scream very loudly when their favorite world gets ignored.

The other products are designed for normal groups, but are set on particular worlds. This shouldn't be an impediment to DMs who have developed their own worlds, however. Any commercial scenario can be dovetailed into a homespun campaign. The premises behind some of these scenarios might not fit your particular campaign, but not every generic adventure will either. You shouldn't ignore a packaged adventure just because you're not interested in the world logo on the front cover.

Would a ***potion of speed*** or ***Wallac's potion of speed casting*** (1992 Collector card #272) reduce the time needed for a sha'ir's gen to find a spell? If not, what sort of item would?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***ring of wizardry*** does nothing for a sha'ir, as they cannot understand the ring's workings, nor use its power. A ***ring of wizardry*** doubles the number of spells a wizard can prepare each day, and sha'irs do not prepare spells daily. They send out their gens to look for spells as needed. Even if a sha'ir could understand how to use a ***ring of wizardry***, the sha'ir's gen still would only bring him one spell at a time and would not depart to search for a new one until the current spell was cast or had expired (see ***Arabian Adventures***, pages 98-99).`,
                `A ***pearl of power*** might work for a sha'ir, but I recommend against it. The item description implies that a pearl's function is based upon a wizard's daily spell preparation, insofar as the pearl only can recall a spell that was part of the wizards most recent preparation. On the other hand, one could argue that a ***pearl of power*** can recall any spell (of the appropriate level) that the user has memorized on a given day. The case can be made that a sha'ir has "memorized" a spell when his gen delivers it, In this case, the ***pearl*** can recall a spell only if the sha'ir has taken "delivery" of a spell of the pearl's level during the day that the pearl is used. For example, a sha'ir who owns a ***pearl of power*** keyed to second-level spells could not use it on a given day until his gen had successfully found and delivered a second. level spell.`,
                `***Wallac's potion of speed casting*** cannot shorten the time a gen requires to locate a spell. I suppose a wish could reduce the time to whatever the minimum would be for the type of spell being sought. For example, a sha'ir could wish that his gen would bring back a "native" sixth-level spell in seven rounds. Any attempt to break the minimum-time requirement using a *wish* should not only fail, but should immediately result in extra-planar attention for the sha'ir as explained under "The Perils of Priest Spells," on page 99—even if the gen is not seeking a priest spell. Stern DMs might roll for extra-planar attention whenever a wish is used to speed spell delivery.`,
                `Note that a sha'ir can benefit from Wallacks potion of speed casting. Once the sha'ir's gen has delivered a spell, the sha'ir must follow all the normal rules for spellcasting, including casting time, which can be reduced by ***Wallac's potion of speed casting***.`,
                `As "Sage Advice" has pointed out before, ***potions of speed***, ***haste*** spells, and similar other magics never shorten a spell's casting time.`

            answer: [
                `The AD&D 2nd edition game does not use segments, and the reference to them in the ***wall of ash*** psionic enchantment description (***Dragon Kings***, page 112) is an error. The spell's creator probably was thinking in terms of the original AD&D game, where a melee round was broken down into 10 segments.`,
                `Spending a full round in contact with a ***wall of ash*** causes 10d10 hp; getting away from the stuff in less than a full round reduces the damage. The easiest way to keep track of this damage is to use the standard initiative system from the current game. For example, Prythony the mul gladiator loses a wrestling match with an opposing half-giant and gets pinned in a ***wall of ash***. If the half-giant's attack came on an initiative number of "7," Prythony probably will spend the rest of the round in the ash, and will suffer 3d10 points of damage, one die on each remaining initiative number (8, 9, and 10). If Prythony rolls free during the next round after getting an adjusted initiative of "4," he'll suffer another 4d10 points of damage. Undoubtedly, things are going to be a lot more complex than this if ***wall of ash*** actually get used in play. However, the DM is going to have to be prepared to deal with such things as they arise—that's one consequence of running a campaign where characters have access to magic as powerful as ***wall of ash***.`,

I don't know exactly what you mean by "elemental powers." However, Elemental magic is not the sole province of the powers that rule the elemental planes. Just about every nature deity in the AD&D® 2nd Edition game grants its priests major access to Elemental spells, as even a cursory glance through ***Legends & Lore*** and other rule-books where deities are detailed will show. I assume the game logic behind this is the fact that nature—at least in the AD&D 2nd Edition game—is composed of the four basic elements: air, earth, fire, and water. In terms of game balance, this change allows druids, and other nature priests who do not have major access to the Divination sphere, to cast the ***commune with nature*** spell. I think most Dungeon Masters and players would agree it is silly to deny the ***commune with nature*** spell to druids, who are the quintessential nature priests.`,

The DM is left to decide what constitutes the psionicist's "front" in this case, but the definite intent here is not to put this under the psionicist's control; exactly where the first portal should appear is up to the DM, but the spirit of the devotion's description would suggest that it should appear directly in front of the psionicist and about an arm's length away. ***CPH***-designer Steve Winter points out the psionicist has some control over the first portal's location just by deciding where he is facing when using the power.

            answer: [
                `Plate mail in either version of the AD&D game is a suit of chain mail with several solid metal plates worn over it for extra protection, so it should be no surprise that it is more expensive than simple chain mail.`,
                `Plate armor is more expensive than either plate mail or chain mail because it has to be custom-fitted for the wearer, while plate mail and chain mail can be worn "off the rack." Furthermore, plate armor is much more intricate than plate mail. A complex system of hinged plates covers the wearer's joints (in a suit of plate mail, the underlying chain mail does this job). Large or small, all the plates in a suit of plate armor are manufactured from thick, high-quality steel that is carefully hammered into the correct shape while the metal is cold. This process not only requires very good steel, it requires large pieces of steel that have a consistently high quality throughout. Chain mail, on the other had, can be manufactured from whatever bits and pieces of iron or steel the armorer has lying around.`,
                `Also, while making chain mail's many separate links is arduous, the armorer has the luxury of tossing out badly made links. An armorer who is hammering out a whole breastplate can't afford even small mistakes—if there is an error, an entire piece has to be thrown out or laboriously remade.`,
                `Finally, plate armor has to be periodically heated and cooled again during manufacture to restore the metal's strength and flexibility in a process called annealing. The armorer must carefully judge just how far he can push, pull, and bend the metal before it has to be annealed. Proper annealing makes a suit of plate armor very strong, but too much annealing yields metal that is much too weak to provide good protection. This additional opportunity for error makes plate armor production even more costly.`

                `Generally, a spell cast from a scroll functions exactly as if the character who wrote scroll cast it from memory; a defiler scroll thus releases defiling magic and a preserver scroll releases preserving magic. I recommend you allow Athasian wizards to automatically know the type of magic on a scroll when they cast ***read magic*** spells to discover the scroll's contents. However, preserving is a more careful and thoughtful approach to magic than defiling, which is a sort of quick-and-dirty magic. If the DM chooses, it is reasonable to assume preservers can make adjustments while reading a scroll that prevent defiling. Likewise, it is reasonable to assume defilers can take shortcuts while reading a preserver scroll in order to release a defiling effect. In these cases, the adjustments are optional and should happen automatically if the character decides to make them. Note whenever an Athasian wizard writes a spell into his spell book, he writes according to his approach to magic, that is, preservers write preserving spells and defilers write defiling spells, even if the spell was discovered on a scroll written by the other type of wizard.`,

                `This is up to the DM. It's possible that defiling works only on Athas. If the DM decides defiling works in other places, then any defiling spell creates an area of lifeless ash according to the amount of plant life in the area where the spell is cast (see the DARK SUN set's ***Rules Book***, page 60). How long it takes the locals to notice the devastation depends on where the defiler starts casting spells, who witnesses the spellcasting, how alert and caring the local deities are, and a whole host of other factors too numerous to mention here. Common sense has to be your guide. If the defiler casts a spell under the royal court wizard's nose, the locals will immediately notice something is up.

If you stacked up the passengers like cordwood instead of letting them sit or stand, you probably could double the passenger load (another 120 creatures).

                `The basic formula for damage is ship tonnage divided by 10, then multiplied by the ship's SR (Ship's Rating). In an atmosphere, one point of SR equals a movement rate of 24. Treat all ramming attacks against structures as head-on rams (see ***War Captain's Companion: Book 3***, page 8); therefore the spelljamming ship itself suffers damage equal to half the damage inflicted on the structure—using your ship as a siege engine can work in a pinch, but it's a losing proposition in the long run.

The real question is how much and how *fast*. The rate at which a creature can imbibe alcohol and still remain lucid depends on a number of factors including general state of health, contents of the digestive tract, and many others. The prime factors, however, are body mass and the strength of the alcoholic beverage. A 150-pound human can expect to be drunk after drinking three ounces of hard liquor or 36 ounces of beer in one hour. An adult umber hulk probably weighs in at about 450 pounds, and probably could put away three times that much alcohol before becoming drunk.`,

The table was arranged in columns of two hit dice, except at the low end, where it essentially was divided into half-hit die increments. THAC0s improved one point per column except that they improved by two on every second column. There also was the phenomenon of the "repeating 20" that I won't even try to explain here. The team eventually decided the old chart was illogical and had to go. The new chart is easier to remember and has the advantage of making things a little easier on PCs in campaigns that start out characters with zero experience points and base starting cash. Play balance in your game probably won't suffer much if you go back to the old chart, just remember to give out a little extra experience to PCs who defeat monsters that have the improved THAC0s.`

It's up to the DM to decide if a Large creature can get the benefits of two-handed use with only one hand. Since a 5' or 6' human can get the two-handed benefit by shifting his grip on sword's long hilt down toward the pommel, I suppose a nine-foot ogre could do the same thing with only one hand. In this case, the ogre has to use the two-handed speed factor. Note that a giant cannot get its extra damage dice unless it uses a weapon of proportionate size in the proper manner. That is, a hill giant might be able to use a bastard sword with one hand and inflict 2d4 points of damage (plus a strength bonus of +7); however, the giant has to use a giant-sized bastard sword in two hands if he wants to inflict 4d4 + 7 points of damage.`,

Troll regeneration can replace body mass destroyed in combat, but it can't maintain the troll's system if it is deprived of food, water, or air. As you point out, they can go at least a week without food or water while regenerating. The DM has to decide how long it takes a troll to starve if completely deprived of food. I'd suggest anywhere from one to six months. In any case, troll regeneration does not need food or a source of matter, it simply replaces lost mass.

            answer: [
                `The rules don't have anything to say about Dexterity bonuses and cover or concealment. To preserve game balance, I suggest that you don't add Dexterity bonuses to modifiers for cover. This prevents characters with high Dexterity scores from becoming virtually immune to missile attacks when they take cover. From the game-logic standpoint, defensive Dexterity adjustments represent an active defense. The character moves in a way that helps defeat attacks. A character hunkered down behind cover is not free to make such movements; a character who is claiming more than 50% cover or concealment probably cannot even see attacks coming and, consequently, cannot respond to them.`,
                `One could make the same game-balance argument about combining magical defensive adjustments with cover, but the game logic doesn't hold up. Magical defensive bonuses function in a variety of ways, but they either make the protected character harder to hurt (by reinforcing armor, skin, and bone) or harder to hit (by deflecting blows, deceiving the attacker, or just serendipitously arranging things in the defender's favor). Taking cover does not interfere with any of these.`,
                `Cover and concealment are never cumulative. "Cover" indicates that the character has found a barrier that can stop incoming attacks. Solid objects such as walls and boulders provide cover. "Concealment" is not sturdy enough to stop attacks, but it does help spoil an attacker's aim by hiding part of the character (this is why concealment is referred to as "soft cover" in the AD&D 2nd Edition game). Bushes, tall grass, and even hanging laundry can provide concealment. Note that cover, by its very nature, offers some concealment and the defensive modifiers for cover already take this into account.`

The discussion of cover and concealment above might lead you to conclude that Dexterity does not help characters using ***shield*** spells, since the spell description says the spell produces an "invisible barrier" in front of the caster. On the other hand, most DMs I know allow ***shield*** users the benefits from their Dexterity bonuses.

In this interpretation, a ***spectral hand*** is strictly an instrument of combat and the magical channel between the caster and the ***hand*** can conduct only baneful magics.

            question: `In one of our game sessions, an NPC priest used a ***word of recall*** while a PC was on his back. As DM, I ruled that the priest and the PC both were transported back to the priest's sanctuary. Was I right?`,
            answer: [
                `You might have been right. Since the priest was not gagged, he could have completed the spell, which has a casting time of 1 and only a verbal component. (If the spell also had a somatic or material component or both, the PC on the priest's back would have prevented the casting. You just can't handle material components or complete somatic gestures while in the midst of a wrestling match.)`,
                `To reach a decision about this situation, you have to balance two conflicting premises: One, game balance absolutely requires that opponents have a chance to disrupt spells by interfering with the caster. Two, the ***word of recall*** spell is a powerful bit of magic that is especially designed to allow the priest to escape when the going gets rough.`,
                `Generally speaking, a character cannot complete a spell if she is hit by an attack or suffers damage during the casting process. However, just having something or somebody sitting on a spell-caster is not necessarily enough to break the character's concentration. If the PC were using the wrestling rules (***DMG***, page 59 or ***PH***, page 97) and had achieved a hold that could be maintained from round to round, I would not allow the spell to be used—you can't concentrate on magic when you're taking any kind of damage. If there was no hold, I'd go to the initiative dice, if the priest wasn't taking damage and beat the PC on initiative, I'd let the spell work. If the priest lost initiative, and the PC made any kind of successful attack, the spell would be ruined and be gone from the priest's memory. In any case, If the priest successfully cast the spell, I'd let the priest choose whether to take the PC along. If the priest did try to take the PC along, you'd need to check the priest's weight limit; if the PC and all the priest's equipment exceeded the weight limit, the spell would fail and the priest would be stuck. Note that, as I mentioned earlier, a gag would prevent the priest from using the spell no matter what was happening—no speech, no verbal component and no spell.`,

The footnote says that only the sword's +3 bonus is considered when calculating the score to sever. Therefore, no score higher than 23 possible—bonuses from strength, specialization, etc. don't apply for this particular purpose. That is, the attack roll must be an unmodified 17 or better before there is a chance to sever a neck (the chance can drop depending on the target's size and construction).

I can understand why there might be an across-the-board difference, but why do some weapons do the same damage to both man-sized and large creatures while some weapons do less damage to large creatures and still others do more damage to large creatures?`,
            answer: [
                `As always, this boils down to questions of game logic and game balance. If you take a look at the tables on pages 68-69 of the ***PH***, you'll notice that most weapons that do less damage to large creatures are type B—crushing and bludgeoning weapons. The sheer body mass of a large creature tends to defeat these kinds of attacks. The remainder are very small, lightweight piercing weapons that have the same problem with large creatures.`,
                `Weapons that do more damage to large creatures tend to be fairly large slashing or piercing weapons that can get at a large creature's vitals.

                `The weapons that do the same damage to opponents of all sizes don't fit neatly into either category. A battle axe, for example, is a chopping weapon with a wedged-shaped blade that cuts well, but can't penetrate too deeply because it is relatively small.`,
                `When considering game balance, note most weapons that do extra damage to Large creatures are off-limits to wizards and most priests. Thieves and a few priests can get some of these weapons, but only warriors can get them all.

For example, a ***contingency*** that unleashes a ***dispel magic*** spell when a door is opened and in turn brings down a ***force field*** that releases a flood of molten metal is a trap.

            answer: [
                `The answers to these questions have appeared in print time and again, but not anytime recently and never in "Sage Advice," so here it goes:`,
                `Some kind of degree in English certainly won't hurt your chances of getting work with TSR, Inc., but your education isn't nearly important as demonstrating the ability to write about games. The best way for you to do this is to get something into print. Start by getting writer's guidelines for DRAGON® Magazine, DUNGEON® Adventures, and for the RPGA® Network (be sure to ask for both POLYHEDRON® Newszine guidelines and the tournament program). Note that the Newszine only accepts material from RPGA Network members, but anyone can submit tournaments. In any case, take what you've learned in your college English classes, write something, and submit it.`,
                `TSR, Inc., calls its "consulting writers" free-lancers, and it uses a fair number of them. However, just about every free-lancer TSR has ever used has had a full-time job and wrote for TSR to earn some extra cash—and for the thrill of it. There just isn't enough money in freelancing to make even a marginal living if that's all you do. So plan on finding a decent job when you graduate.`,
                `There are two official channels for inquiring about employment at TSR. One is the personnel department, which handles hiring; TSR's business address is printed on the back cover and title page of every TSR product. Adding the words "Attention Personnel Department" to the address on your letter will speed up any response. Frankly, writing to the personnel department probably will just get you a polite form letter, but you asked the question. The other channels are the various submissions editors. For magazines, write to the editorial address shown on the masthead—but get writing guidelines before you submit anything, and don't bother with resumes and long letters describing your life history. The Games Department of TSR does not consider submissions from unpublished authors; you have to get some experience first. If you don't have any luck with TSR's professional magazines, try writing for some of the industry's other companies (and their magazines), or see if you can locate a good fanzine or game-club newsletter. The latter small, amateur publications won't make you famous, but they're a good place to get your feet wet.`

                `Generally, yes. This also is the case in both editions of the AD&D game, too.`,
                `Unless the monster description states otherwise, undead have no special ability to detect creatures that are invisible, hidden, silent, or otherwise concealed.

                `I have encountered campaigns that assume undead creatures can somehow sense living creatures. The reasoning goes something like this: Undead have no functioning sense organs—their eyes, ears, etc.—have rotted away. Since they can detect neither light nor sound, their "senses" operate in some arcane manner that makes invisibility or silence irrelevant. This house rule can add a new dimension to undead, even to lowly creatures such as skeletons and zombies; however, the published rules assume that undead somehow really do see, hear, etc. If you decide to adopt an undead "sense life" rule, increase each undead monster's experience value to reflect this special ability to see invisible creatures. Also, you'll need to decide on a number of other parameters for the ability, such as its range and what, if anything, blocks or disrupts it.`

Could the iron be used for weapons, armor, and tools? If the wizard kept a piece of a ***wall of iron***, could she use it as the material components for more spells? Would this also be true for ***wall of stone*** or ***wall of ice***?`,
            answer: [
                `Iron is worth one gold piece (100 ceramic pieces) per pound in DARK SUN® campaigns (see ***Dune Trader***, page 72). A ***wall of iron*** contains a minimum of 12,403 lbs. of iron (about 25 cubic feet at 490 pounds per cubic foot). However, in DARK SUN campaigns, a ***wall of iron*** spell has a duration of one turn per caster level (see the DARK SUN rule book, page 93). A wizard might be able to sell a few chunks of iron as a scam, but the practice will catch up with her if she tries it too often.`,
                `While the material in a ***wall of iron*** functions as normal iron in most respects, there is no reason why a Dungeon Master has to assume it can be worked as regular metal can. For example, the DM might decide that iron from a ***wall of iron*** contains certain impurities that cause it to form useless lumps of slag if heated and worked, and that it simply flakes apart if worked cold. Note also that, regardless of its duration, metal from a ***wall of iron*** radiates magic and can be dispelled. Even if it could be used to manufacture items, those items can be destroyed by ***dispel magic*** effects.`,
                `Having material components for spells is an optional rule. I don't know any DM who uses this rule and also lets his players get around it by using magically created material components—this is a question of game balance. From the standpoint of game logic, the dweomer that maintains the ***wall of iron*** or other magically created material either interferes with the spellcasting process or unravels during the process. First, attempts to cast spells using a magically created object as a material component are disrupted. Second, the magically created material component ceases to be and it just isn't available to complete the spell. In either case. the attempted spell fails. Some exceptions exist. Generally, items brought into being by a ***wish*** work fine as material components, at least if the component is not rare or valuable; and a ***Zagyg's spell component case*** (from ***Unearthed Arcana***) always produces usable material components.`

The first thing the DM has to do is identify the most notable and powerful good-aligned NPCs in the game; such characters are certain to make overtures to an avangion when they learn that such a creature exists. Likewise, most neutral and good folk who meet an adventuring avangion are going to take a liking to the character (unless the player controlling it is a complete idiot).

Judging from my conversations with Tim Brown, ***Dragon Kings*** author, advanced beings obey all the rules for spellcasting (see "Sage Advice," issue #189), which means they must sleep to regain spells. Otherwise, the DM is free to assume that avangions never rest. Since the rules say that an avangion's mouth begins to disappear as its form evolves, it would be reasonable to assume that avangions of 25th level or higher either don't eat at all or eat unusual materials, such as the silver linings of clouds, moonlight reflected off cactus spines, or the like. Perhaps only fully transformed avangions are completely self-contained. Lower-level avangions who still have basically human forms probably have to eat, but this, too, is up to the DM.`,

                `Yes, avangions can use these spells. Nevertheless, the caster must *walk*. While avangions of 26th level and above cannot walk in their natural forms, nothing prevents them from using spells or psionics to change into something that ***can*** walk.

Note that the avangion can stop and renew a spell if he needs to, so long as the Prolific Forestation or Prolific Vegetation spell is not interrupted for more than a full round.`,

            question: `The ***Player's Handbook*** states that elves routinely live up to 1,200 years. Given this, I cannot fathom why elves suffer a -1 Constitution penalty. The rules do say that elves are not as "sturdy" as humans, but this is illogical. If anything, elves should get a +1 bonus to Constitution due to their hardiness and longevity.`,
            answer: [
                `Longevity is not necessarily synonymous with hardiness. A parrot lives a lot longer than a horse, but horses have much better Constitution scores than parrots do. Still, play balance in your campaign probably won't suffer if you fiddle with demihuman racial modifiers a bit. If you want to give elves a Constitution bonus, just eliminate the Dexterity bonus and assign a penalty to some other ability score; elves in your campaign might have lower Wisdom scores since their long years tend to make them a bit frivolous and impulsive.`,

                `The passage on page 17 is erroneous. It refers to Table 22, Wizard Specialist Requirements, in the ***PH*** (page 31). It should read: "Because the only wizard specialties available to elves are Diviner and Enchanter, grey elves usually do not become specialist wizards."`,

Healthy plants also require lots of water, soil, and 12-18 hours of sunlight each day. Note that some darkness also is essential for healthy plants. These limitations make them impractical for spelljammers. The only reason plants can help maintain planetary atmospheres is because they vastly outnumber the animals.`,

Can the caster pass through solid objects such as stone? Can he travel underwater? Can the caster move in three dimensions? For example, can he descend into the ocean? Does the water even exist as far as the spell-caster is concerned?`,
            answer: [
                `Since the spell's primary use is for rapid travel on the Prime Material plane (in fact, the caster never actually leaves the Prime Material plane), I suggest that you allow the user to see the portion of the Prime Material that immediately surrounds him. What the character sees is a monochromatic mass of shadows, just like what is visible at twilight (see table 62 from the revised ***PH***, page 117). Since the caster is traveling at 126 miles an hour (seven leagues a turn), he probably isn't going to seem too many details while moving—objects would fly by in one gray blur.`,
                `The spell does not grant the power of flight, but it does negate most terrain penalties. The caster can dash along the bottom of the ocean, through swamps, and over mountains. In any case, the caster traces a path along the ground. When traveling across a gorge, for example, the caster moves down one canyon wall, across the bottom, and up the other wall. The caster can pass through cracks as though using a ***wraithform*** spell, but cannot pass through solid objects. Note that the caster must be is a mass of deep shadows to begin the spell, and I suggest that the caster always must end in shadows as well.`,

(Just how did Ailuj save that village from a great wyrm when she was only 16? Or why is that gold dragon doing just about everything that lich tells him to and how do we stop it?). There is no save vs. this spell, so the reference to a save in the spell description (issue #182, page 12) probably is supposed to refer to the dragon's magic resistance, if it is old enough to have any.`,

            answer: [
                `Generally speaking, when the irresistible force (***sword of wounding*** prevents magical healing short of a ***wish***) meets the immovable object (***periapt of wound closure*** prevents all open, bleeding wounds) you should rule in favor of the defensive power.`,
                `In the case of a ***sword of wounding***, the periapt prevents the wearer from taking the extra points of bleeding damage each round—the wound closes. In addition, the periapt wearer heals naturally at double the normal rate even if struck by a ***sword of wounding***. The DM is free to rule that the periapt also allows magical healing of damage from a ***sword of wounding***. I know many DMs who consider a ***periapt of wound closure*** to be equal to or better than a ***wish*** when it comes to healing wounds. If you follow the item's description to the letter, however, you'll come to a different conclusion. While the periapt allows the healing of wounds that wouldn't do so otherwise, ***sword of wounding*** damage heals naturally at the normal rate. The periapt's "heal anything" power always applies to such things as damage inflicted by mummies, which normally do not heal unless a ***cure disease*** spell is applied first. In this case, the periapt wearer recovers hit points at the normal rate. He still is infected with mummy rot, however, and will die eventually if the disease is not cured. The item's description makes no specific mention of allowing magical healing that otherwise would not be possible, only normal healing that wouldn't otherwise be possible.`,
                `A ***periapt of wound closure*** does not prevent damage nor does it provide instantaneous healing. So I can't think of any reason why the wearer couldn't have her appendages severed by a ***sword of sharpness*** or otherwise forcibly removed—though the periapt would prevent any additional damage from bleeding that the DM might otherwise assign for the loss of an appendage.`

If a familiar dies of old age does the wizard still have to make a system shock check and lose one point of Constitution? What happens to a familiar if its wizard dies? Can a familiar's hit points ever be increased?`,
            answer: [
                `The spell description (see ***PH***, page 134) says the spell grants the familiar an exceptionally long life. It is up to the DM to define this, but I suggest that the familiar should have a basic longevity equal to the standard lifespan for the spell-caster's race (see ***PH***, table 11, page 24). For example, a human caster's familiar would live 90 +2d20 years. To calculate the familiar's starting age, use the figures on table 11, but treat any maximum dice results as minimums. For example, a human's familiar would have a starting age of 16-18 years—base 15 + 1d4 years, treating a rolled "4" as a "1". Given this approach, a familiar should not be in danger of dying of old age before the caster does unless it is exposed to magical aging or unless the caster receives a magical boost to his own lifespan. In either of these cases, the caster is obliged to care for his familiar, and the DM should inflict the full penalty if the caster allows the familiar to die. Note that ***wishes***, ***potions of longevity***, and other magics that can extend a character's lifespan also work on familiars.`,
                `The spell description says a familiar loses one hit point a day if separated from the caster. One could argue that death certainly is a separation. If the caster is raised or resurrected before the familiar dies, the familiar is saved. On the other hand, the DM might rule that the familiar can avoid hit-point loss simply by remaining within one mile of the caster's body. In any case, the bond between the caster and the familiar should be dissolved at some point if the caster dies and is not raised or resurrected. The dissolution of the bond ends the familiar's dependence on the caster and frees the familiar from the caster's control. The DM is free to decide how long it takes for the bond to dissolve; it might dissolve instantly on the caster's death, which would force the wizard to summon a new familiar any time he dies and is brought back, and it probably should be no longer that a number of days equal to the familiar's hit points.`,
                `The spell description says a familiar has 2-4 hit points plus one hit point per caster level. I suggest you take this literally and give the familiar an extra hit point whenever the caster gains a new level.`

            question: `What happens when you put a ***bag of holding*** and a ***portable hole*** together? A friend told me you get something like a nuclear explosion. Also, after reading DRAGON issue #192, I began to wonder what would happen if you put a ***bag of holding*** or ***portable hole*** into a ***bag of devouring***?`,
            answer: [
                `See the ***portable hole*** description in the ***DMG***, page 177 for the consequences of putting one of these items inside another. There are no explosions, but characters might wish there was one instead.`,
                `It is up to the DM to decide what happens when an extra-dimensional space is placed inside a ***bag of devouring***. I can think of two possible outcomes: One, the ***bag of devouring*** works normally—it swallows the bag or hole just as it swallows any other bit of animal or vegetable matter. Since a ***portable hole*** is made of some pretty peculiar stuff, it's possible that the monster won't decide the hole is food and won't swallow the hole immediately (see ***DMG***, page 159. This might make it possible to remove the ***portable hole*** before it's too late. (In campaigns where this happens, foolhardy PCs just might decide this is a good way to test magical bags to see if they are bags of devouring; however, this is not a very smart thing to do when you consider the possible danger.) Two, the ***bag of devouring*** acts like any other extradimensional space. In the case of a the ***portable hole***, a gate opens to another plane and everything within a 10' radius is sucked in. Sadistic DMs will decide that the other plane is the monster's gullet, but this doesn't have to be the case. Technically, both items should be destroyed when the gate opens, severing the connection between the bag and the monster. The rules are unclear about what happens when you try to place one ***bag of holding*** inside another, so I recommend that the ***bag of devouring*** either quietly swallow the ***bag of holding*** or that the ***bag of devouring*** simply ruptures and dumps its contents into nilspace just as a ***bag of holding*** does if overloaded (see the ***DMG***, page 160).`,

            answer: [
                `A lawful alignment generally does imply a desire for order, but not necessarily a liking for bureaucracy. War by its very nature is disruptive and chaotic, so its natural antithesis is law. Furthermore, finding peaceful solutions to conflicts, and identifying conflicts that cannot be solved peacefully, requires patience, dedication, and self discipline. Consider the great degree of self sacrifice that most United Nations peacekeeping efforts require—peacekeepers have to set a non-violent example and tend to be in great danger all the time. These are not virtues associated with chaos. Note that lawful-good creatures seek what is best for the greatest possible number of thinking, deserving beings. This generally includes some measure of freedom and diversity—elves are just as deserving of the fruits of peace as are dwarves, halflings, humans, and other races who have enough self control not to act in a predatory fashion all the time. Only neutral or evil lawful beings seek to establish rigid codes that much be slavishly followed.`,

                `Creatures on the Demi-Plane of Dread still have alignments, even though divination magic cannot detect or identify their auras. RAVENLOFT characters are in no way exempt from alignment restrictions. Note also that RAVENLOFT campaign player characters must be very careful about evil actions, as these can cause Ravenloft powers checks, which eventually can transform the character into a DM-controlled creature.`,

                `I suppose one could test a character's alignment by tricking him into picking up an aligned sword. All such attempts should be played out, with the DM making sure that the NPC in question is suitably wary. Note that this kind of testing can be both unreliable and dangerous. For example, if a party finds a magical sword in one of Ravenloft's domains, they have no easy way to check its alignment, even if they handle it themselves. If a sword has a lawful-neutral alignment, any lawful character can handle it safely (see the ***Dungeon Master's Guide***, page 187), and the PCs might just arm a lawful-evil adversary. Likewise, a sword with a chaotic-good alignment is dangerous to any character who is not chaotic good. Handing such a weapon to a potentially friendly lawful-good NPC is certain to sour relations.`

The character could attempt to add a spell from her wizard list to her bard list, but would have to make a second "chance to know" roll. When memorizing spells, the character cannot cross lists. For example, if the character knew ***magic missile*** as a wizard, but not as a bard, she could memorize this spell only as a wizard and could not use her bard spell "slots" to memorize extra ***magic missile*** spells.

                `Since the kit description describes the dodge ability as a sudden, agile leap to safety, I'm inclined to suggest that you treat a dodge as an action. If the jongleur loses initiative, she can either use her dodge ability or forego it, weather the attack, and take another action. If the jongleur wins initiative and takes an action, she cannot dodge until the next round. Alternatively, you might allow a jongleur who has won initiative and taken an action to dodge during the same round if she beats the opponent's die roll—each character rolls 1d6, if the jongleur rolls higher, she can attempt to dodge. If the roll is tied or the jongleur rolls lower than her opponent, she has to take her lumps like any other character.`,

            answer: [
                `You resolve this contest the same way you'd resolve any other psychic contest. Many readers seem to be confused by the fact that the psychic contest rules (see ***The Complete Psionics Handbook***, pages 22-24) use attack and defense modes as an example. All psychic combat takes the form of a psychic contest, but you use the psychic contest mechanics whenever two or more psychic powers are in conflict—the presence or lack of attack or defense modes notwithstanding. As one example, if two wild-talent psionicists are trying to Telekinese an object, use the psychic contest rules. In your example, the character using Synaptic Static uses his Synaptic Static power score for the contest and the other psionicist uses her Elongation power score. If the Synaptic Static user wins the contest, the Elongation power fails. If the Synaptic Static user initiated the power first, he is the defender in the contest and he wins ties. If the Synaptic Static user initiates the power in order to disrupt the Elongation power, he is the attacker.`,

            question: `There seem to be some very similar proficiencies in the ***Complete Spacefarer's Handbook*** and the ***War Captain's Companion***. In particular, ***Spacefarer's*** features Wildspace Navigation, Phlogiston Navigation, Slow Respiration, Signaling, and Zero-Gravity Combat. On the other hand, ***War Captain's*** offers Celestial Navigation, Slow Breathing, Semaphore, and Freefall. Generally, these proficiencies have similar purposes, but different game mechanics.`,
            answer: [
                `These two works actually were developed in parallel, one by the TSR, Inc. staff and the other by freelancers, so the overlap isn't surprising. While you are correct that the proficiencies in question are very similar, their game effects can be quite different.`,
                `The three Navigation proficiencies seem to be similar on the surface, but work differently. The ***Spacefarer's*** skills allow a navigator to move more efficiently between points in space. (This implies that the navigator knows where he is, but this isn't necessarily the case. The only thing the navigator really knows is what to do in order to get where he's going in the shortest possible time, which could be a seat-of-the-pants undertaking.) The ***War Captain's*** skill allows a navigator to know exactly where his ship is in relation to his destination (and to the rest of the sphere if he also has the Astronomy proficiency). Celestial Navigation also allows the character to direct ramming attacks. All three proficiencies allow navigators to avoid hazards. If you have both books, you might consider requiring a character to know Celestial Navigation before learning Wildspace or Phlogiston Navigation (though dropping Celestial Navigation altogether would makes things a lot simpler for PCs).`,
                `Slow Respiration is a mental skill (based on the character's unmodified Wisdom score) that is fairly easy to use; it also incapacitates the character, allowing no other actions. Slow Breathing is a difficult physical act (based on Constitution score -5), which has the same effect as Slow Respiration but allows the characters to at least move around. Further, a character using Slow Breathing can converse, eat, and even fight if she makes an additional proficiency check. Slow Respiration is best for most characters because it doesn't carry a huge ability-score penalty. However, a character with a very high Constitution score might be better off with Slow Breathing. The logic behind both proficiencies seems sound to me, and your campaign won't suffer if you make both proficiencies available.`,
                `Semaphore and Signaling do virtually the same thing, so use your judgment and pick one for your game. Signaling is easier to use (Intelligence +2 instead of unmodified Intelligence for Semaphore), but Semaphore allows the user to send and receive messages more quickly if he spends extra slots on the skill. Whatever you pick, it would be best to drop the other proficiency from your game.`,
                `Freefall allows a character to temporarily ignore sudden shifts in gravity. This is quite different from Zero-Gravity Combat, which allows a character to fight normally in the total absence of gravity—and even move around a bit. Both these proficiencies should be useful to spacefarers. Note these skills don't overlap: Freefall does not negate the combat penalties for fighting in the absence of gravity (see ***Concordance of Arcane Space***, page 14). Likewise, Zero-Gravity Combat does not prevent a character from being tossed about, perhaps catastrophically, when her ship's gravity plane shifts.`

If this blows the play-balance in the game, however, the DM should feel free to treat some granted powers just like spells that the character gets automatically without praying or special effort. Basically, the more like a spell a granted power is, the more justification the DM has for ruling that it can be disrupted. If a power can be disrupted, it should work in play just like a spell, with a casting time, a full-fledged verbal component, and maybe even a somatic and material component.

Note that some initiative bonuses, such as being ***hasted***, set to receive a charge, or being on high ground don't apply; in this case, the initiative roll reflects the caster's ability to concentrate during the spell's entire casting time, it does not reflect the caster's ability to beat an opponent to the punch.

                `If you carefully read the double-arrow shot description (***CBE*** page 73), you'll find that the archer can fire only one additional arrow in the round the archer took the double-arrow shot. This is an inherent limitation to the double-arrow trick, since it takes extra time to properly arrange the arrows on the bowstring. Note that only two arrows can be placed in the bow at once. Also, no archer can make two double-arrow shots in the same round without a ***haste*** spell or similar magic. I suppose the elf could declare a quick-draw in addition to a double-arrow, but since the elf still can use the bow only twice, he would incur the quick-draw "to hit" penalties for nothing. Otherwise, an elf can combine the other types of trick shots; just add up the modifiers. Of course, the elf needs to make special preparations to combine some kinds of shots. For example, an elf using a quick-draw from a hanging-tree position wouldn't have enough arrows on hand to make her multiple shots without some sort of special equipment to keep the arrows in her quiver as she hangs upside down.`,

                `The Astral plane is not a toxic or inherently hostile environment, so getting sent there is not fatal in and of itself. On the other hand, there are plenty of astral monsters and other hazards, so your errant traveler still could be in trouble.`,

If the character has no such means at hand, the DM can construct an adventure for the character that allows for some chance of escape; perhaps the character can find a natural portal between the planes or strike a deal with a passing creature that has planar-traveling abilities. You can get more detailed information on the Astral plane in the PLANESCAPE™ *Adventures* boxed set, which will be released in April, 1994.`

            question: `What happens to a dual-classed character if the level of his original class is suddenly boosted so that it matches or exceeds the level in his current class? For example, a 6th-level fighter/7th-level mage would normally be free to use his warrior and wizard abilities without penalty because his mage level exceeds his fighter level. If the character reads a ***manual of puissant skill at arms*** and becomes a 7th-level fighter, what happens? Does the character have to go back to choosing which class he will use for each adventure until he reaches 8th level as a mage?`,
            answer: [
                `Judging from the text on page 45 of the ***PH***, it's pretty clear to me that the character has to go back to choosing which class to use again, just as he would if he were to lose a level to an energy drain and became a 6th-level mage.`,
                `It would be entirely reasonable for the DM to rule that the character cannot benefit from the manual at all. The text on page 45 says that a dual-classed character never can gain experience in a class once it has been abandoned in favor of another class. The only exception to this is that a character can replace levels that are lost somehow.`,
                `Considering the rarity and power of magical books, I don't think the campaign would suffer if the manual worked; the character is not actually devoting any time or energy to studying the old class—he's just the recipient of a big power dump. The DM, however, would not be violating the spirit of the rules by not allowing it; there's no compelling reason to automatically assume the character can retain or utilize what the book grants.`

            question: `Can characters carrying around a ***mirror of retention*** use it to "film" their adventures? Can the mirror be used to capture short "takes" as long as the total recording time doesn't exceed the ***mirror's*** capacity of 24 hours? Can the ***mirror*** be used to capture sunlight to provide illumination and confound undead? Can the ***mirror*** be used to copy maps or scrolls?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***mirror of retention*** (from the ***Tome of Magic***, page 140) must be hung in a room no larger than 50' square and commanded before it will function. If the ***mirror*** is removed from the wall, it stops recording. It can be played back anywhere, however. I suppose a party could carry a ***mirror of retention*** from place to place in a dungeon or large building, and use it to take snapshots, but remember that it doesn't work unless it is hung in a room that does not exceed the size limit. The party could hang it on a wall and use it to record an encounter in a chamber, but if the PCs are carrying the ***mirror*** during an encounter it records nothing.`,
                `A ***mirror of retention*** can record sunlight streaming into a room, but the image played back on the ***mirror*** is just that, an image. The recorded sunlight has no affect on undead and the light the mirror sheds during playback is very faint, no brighter than a television screen in a dark room. The playback could be used as a weak light source in a pinch, but a character couldn't see very much with it.`,
                `If the ***mirror*** is properly hung and operated, it could record a map or other piece of mundane writing—provided the room where the ***mirror*** is hung has sufficient light for reading at the time of recording. The ***mirror*** also could record a superficial image of a magical scroll, but such images are useless; they cannot be used to cast any spells inscribed on the scroll or to add the spells to a spell book; it takes the original scroll—in its entirety—to produce its magical effects. Note that if the image in the ***mirror*** were usable, then the writing on the scroll would fade as soon as it was recorded. Subsequently, if the image is read or copied from the ***mirror*** it fades away, too. A scroll can be used only once, and player characters cannot get around this limitation easily, and certainly not through a ***mirror of retention***.`

            answer: [
                `Nothing special happens when the spell is cast in close quarters. A ***mirror image*** spell not only creates multiple images, but considerable distortion as well. In this case, the distortion is probably just a little stronger than normal. Provided the caster is free to move, attacks against the caster still have a chance to be misdirected. On the other hand, if the caster has his head on a chopping block, a ***mirror image*** spell isn't going to make the headsman miss. Barring this kind of situation—one where it is clear to the DM that the attacker knows exactly where the caster is—a ***mirror image*** works normally.`,

                `The table included with each dragon's description gives the number of spells a dragon can know. This number varies with the type of dragon and its age category. A dragon's repertoire of spells is fixed and cannot be changed or expanded. Gold dragons are the sole exception to this in the core AD&D game rules—they actually keep spell books. The DM is free to decide how gold dragons go about getting new spells, but I suggest you use the normal spell acquisition and research rules for wizards. The ***Council of Wyrms*** boxed set, which will be released in June, 1994 will contain lots of new material on dragons, including dragon spell-casters.`,

            question: `What happens when a character wears two items that bestow magic resistance, say an ***amulet of magic resistance*** and a ***robe of the archmagi***?`,
            answer: [
                `This is up to the DM, but I strongly recommend that only the most powerful item functions. In other words, if the character in your example had an ***amulet of magic resistance***, 20% along with the ***robe of the archmagi***, which grants 5% magic resistance, the character still would have only a 20% magic resistance (from the ring). I recommend that you apply this rule even for naturally magic resistant creatures such as drow or tanar'ri. Magic resistance in the AD&D 2nd Edition game is a powerful ability, and once the DM lets it get out of hand, your game balance probably will go right out the window.`,
                `If you're playing the AD&D 1st Edition game, where magic resistance is adjusted according to the level of the caster and a magic-resistant creature can't necessarily walk around causing magical effects to collapse, you can afford to be a little more lenient. Even then, be careful. High-level games give you a little more breathing room; at low level, magic resistance in the original game is even more formidable that it is in the current game. If you decide to make magic resistance cumulative in your original AD&D campaign, you still should not allow magic resistance to accumulate if it comes from similar sources. A drow wearing a ***robe of the archmagi*** could add the 5% to her natural magic resistance, and wizard could add the values of a ***robe of the archmagi*** and an ***amulet of magic resistance***. No character, however should be able to wear two ***amulets of magic resistance*** and add their effects together, only the most powerful amulet should function.`

                `Unless the spells description says otherwise, all area effects hit automatically. The spell-caster decides where the effect will originate (within the limits of the spell) and the DM decides who or what is within the area of effect. Other area effects, such as dragon breath, work exactly the same way. In the case of dragon breath, the dragon "aims" the breath weapon as it wishes and anything caught in it must save vs. the effect. There are several other forms of attack that don't require attack rolls, such as gaze weapons and mental attacks. Note that while such attacks always "hit" they don't always work; most of these attacks allow a saving throw that negates or reduces the effect.`,

            question: `How does a priest or cleric character create holy water?`,
            answer: [
                `According to ***The Complete Priests Handbook***, three priests (or clerics) of the same faith of at least 2nd level must get together in a temple dedicated to their deity and pray for a full hour. At the end of the hour, they must cast ***create water***, ***protection from evil***, and ***purify food and drink***. This process creates a half gallon of holy water (16 four-ounce vials). Any extra water from the ***create water*** spell must be channeled off before the ritual is complete, or the DM can assume that the extra water simply disappears during the ritual. For every two priests added to the group, an additional half gallon of holy water can be created, up to a maximum of four gallons of holy water at one time. I strongly suggest that you require holy water to be held in specially ***blessed*** vials (cost 2-5 gp each). You might also require an expensive font and basin (value 100-10,000 gp, depending on capacity) to hold the holy water while it's being created and dispensed into vials. If the DM wants more control over who creates holy water and when, it wouldn't be unreasonable to add extra spells to the ritual. I'd suggest ***chant***, (to be maintained the whole time) ***bless***, ***prayer*** and possibly ***combine***. The required vials can be ***blessed*** in a similar ritual, which is required to make the ***blessing*** permanent.`,

            answer: [
                `This is entirely up to the DM. I suggest that regeneration not reduce Constitution or require a resurrection-survival roll. A regenerating creature never truly dies, though it can be incapacitated by a grievous injury. Once the character drops to zero or fewer hit points, however, the character is unconscious or incapacitated even if the "Hovering on Deaths Door" rule is in use. Note that a character hovering on deaths door does not actually die until he reaches -10 hit points; if the DM has decided that regenerating back from death would reduce the character's Constitution score, the point is not lost unless death actually occurs.`,

The priest might have to undergo training as she advances in levels, but this is an optional rule (see ***DMG***, page 49) and should apply to all classes if a campaign uses it. Note that priests can invent or acquire entirely new spells in much the same way as wizards can. In this case, the priest must spend time and money discovering and learning the new prayers.`,

            answer: [
                `Unless the DM wants to encourage some truly egregious abuse of this spell, I suggest that any solid barrier stops a ***wall of fire*** or similar spell. In this case, unless the tower wall as an opening at least 20' tall to admit the ***wall of fire***, the effect stops when it encounters the tower. I don't think it's reasonable to have the whole spell collapse, but the DM might force to spell-caster to reduce the radius until the ***wall of fire*** fits in the space available, or to use the sheet version of the spell arranged in a ring; this version has a total area that is less than one tenth of the ring's area. Or, the DM can just rule that there is a gap in the ring where it intersects the tower.`,

            answer: [
                `There's nothing in the spell description that leads me to believe that a ***flaming sphere*** has to be cast on the ground. If cast in the air, it would fall straight down at its normal movement rate (30' a round) until it strikes the ground; if the ***sphere's*** duration hasn't expired before it hits the ground, it begins rolling in the direction the caster was pointing at the time of casting.`,
                `Treat the ***sphere*** as an in-place effect when adjudicating magic resistance. That is, the ***sphere*** collapses if the magic-resistance roll succeeds. Note that there are several in-place spells that actually are mobile, including ***protection from evil***, which moves with the recipient, and some of the ***wall*** spells, which can be pushed over or dropped on creatures.`,
                `The DM has to decide theatrical details such as how much light a ***flaming sphere*** sheds. The impression I get from the description is that the ball looks a lot like a big, glowing coal. It shows up pretty well in the dark—and really screws up infravision—but it doesn't shed much light at all, maybe enough to show vague detail within about six inches of the sphere.`

Attack spells such as ***magic missile*** or ***fireball*** work, too, but, only when cast at ethereal targets. The DM must decide about spells and psionic disciplines that fall in between. ***Clairvoyance***, for example, cannot cross planer boundaries and I'm inclined to suggest that a caster in ***wraithform*** can scry only ethereal locations.

            question: `Exactly how much damage does the ***defiling regeneration*** spell (from the DARK SUN® setting's ***Dragon Kings*** book) inflict on attackers? For example, if a 30th-level defiler is battling a druid, how much damage does the druid suffer for each point of damage inflicted on the defiler?`,
            answer: [
                `You seem to be confusing the damage caused by casting a defiling spell with the hit points the defiler *regenerates* as result of casting the spell. The druid in your example suffers no damage at all. Creatures protected by ***defiling regeneration*** draw energy at the expense of the land, not their opponents. They *regenerate* at a flat rate of 2 hit points per round if damaged but still above 0 hit points, and 1 point per round if reduced to 0 hit points or less. Note that when the recipient reaches full hit points she is no longer damaged and stops *regenerating*.`,
                `The ***defiling regeneration*** spell produces a minor defiling effect similar to what a normal defiler spell produces, but the area is very small-no larger than the protected creature's feet. This is why a battlefield where ***defiling regeneration*** has been used is littered with ashen footprints instead of great circles of ash. An opponent engaged in combat with a protected creature does not suffer any pain or initiative penalties as she would if caught in the area of destruction created when a defiler casts a normal spell. I suppose an opponent could be hurt if a creature protected by this spell was *regenerating* while in flesh-to-flesh contact (as might be the case during wrestling or overbearing combat), but the only effect would be non-damaging pain and the accompanying initiative penalty.`,
                `***Defiling regeneration*** is a defiling magic, however. The act of casting this spell kills all plants within 3-30 yards (depending on the terrain, see ***Rules Book***, page 601, leaving an area of lifeless ash in their place. Living animals, monsters, and people within 30 yards suffer 1d6 points of damage for every experience level the caster has gained over 20 (see ***DK***, page 44). The caster might inadvertently kill the creatures he is trying to protect with this spell unless he is careful to place them outside this damage radius.`

            question: `I've been busy compiling a list of spells from various AD&D game products, and I've hit a snag. In several places, different books give different levels for the same spell, for example, ***dispel illusion*** is listed at third level in the original ***Player's Handbook*** and fourth level in ***Oriental Adventures***. Which should I use? Also there are a few spells that are so similar that I don't know which to use, for example ***mummy rot*** from ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook*** and ***mummy's touch*** from the FORGOTTEN REALMS® ***Adventures*** book.`,
            answer: [
                `Generally speaking, you should go with the most recently published material. Other considerations sometimes take precedence, however. In the case of ***dispel illusion***, for example, you're dealing with a spell that has been written out of the current game. Illusionists in the original game got this spell as a third-level spell, and wu jen (who are generalists) got it as a fourth-level spell. In the current game, illusionists don't get Abjurations at all, so I recommend pegging ***dispel illusion*** at fourth level.`,
                `If you're playing a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, you probably ought to use ***mummy's touch*** because it was created for FR campaigns. If you use another world, your decision depends on how nice you want to be to spell-casters. ***Mummy's touch*** is generally more powerful than ***mummy rot***, and is two levels lower to boot (magic on Toril tends to be potent). On the other hand, mummy' s touch has a save, and ***mummy rot*** does not (at least when the spell is used against a human, demihuman, or humanoid).

Our PC group was recently set upon by a horde of foes, each protected by more than 100 ***stoneskins***. Will ***stoneskin*** protect a character from falling damage? How may "attacks" will a protected character lose if an opponent hurls a handful of small objects (rocks or gems) at her from close range?`,
            answer: [
                `The spell description doesn't give any limit to the number of ***stoneskin*** spells a creature can enjoy at once. This, however, can lead to tremendous abuse. (One hundred ***stoneskins*** each? Give me a break!) I strongly suggest that you roll only once for the number of attacks a ***stoneskin*** spell negates and that this number applies no matter how many spells subsequently are cast on the recipient. For example, if a 20th-level wizard casts three ***stoneskin*** spells on a fighter, roll 1d4 + 10 for the number of attacks negated. If the roll is a "2" the fighter is protected from 12 and only 12 attacks. Once 12 attacks negate the spell the fighter can receive a fourth spell and can make a new roll. I also recommend that you give ***stoneskin*** a maximum duration of one day. This prevents a wizard with time on her hands from casting ***stoneskin*** on every soldier in an army.`,
                `***Stoneskin*** protects against physical attacks in which something is hurled or struck against the victim: cuts, slashes, blows, bites, claws, tail slaps, etc. Magical and energy attacks are not negated. One could make a case for treating a fall as a blow, but I recommend against it. The recipient becomes something like a big statue, which is generally immune to blows, but it still can shatter if it's pushed out a window and falls to the ground. Note that the character is protected from caveins and avalanches, as these are situations where objects are hitting the character. Note also that magical attacks work against the character no matter how the spell delivers damage; ***magic missiles***, ***lightning bolts***, ***ice storms***, and the various ***Bigby' s hand*** spells go right through ***stoneskins***.`,
                `Generally speaking, one of a ***stoneskin's*** protections is negated for each attack roll made against the character. A reasonable DM is going to call for one roll if a handful of pebbles is thrown at a target because all the pebbles are released at about the same time and all hit at about the same time, so this kind of attack should count against a ***stoneskin*** spell only once. Otherwise, a character could blow down a ***stoneskin*** by hurling handfuls of sand or dust. Likewise, an avalanche or cave-in negates one attack. Arrows, on other hand, come at their targets one at a time.`

If two modes can be used at once, does it requires a "six-finger" contact to attack the defender's mind?`,
            answer: [
                `As my colleague Rich Baker has pointed out the way in which psionic defenses are structured and the round-by-round limits of power use makes using two defense modes at the same time impossible. A psionicist can initiate one power each round, plus one defense mode, and can maintain any number of powers provided that he has sufficient PSPs (see ***CPH***, page 22). However, of the five defense modes (Mind Blank, Thought Shield, Mental Barrier, Tower of Iron Will, and Intellect Fortress) only mind blank can be maintained. The other four defense modes must be reinitiated each round (that is what the "na" under maintenance cost means). Mind Blank automatically switches off when another defense mode is initiated (see the power's description on page 88, 2nd and 5th paragraphs). Since a character can initiate only one defense each round, and no defense lasts more than a single round (except for Mind Blank with its automatic switch off) it's pretty difficult for a character to have two defense modes operating at once. If through some unusual twist of fate a character does have two defense modes operating at once, she gets the benefit of only the best one, and it still takes only three tangents to force a contact. ***Haste*** spells do not allow characters to violate the one-power-one-defense limit. Also, the Split Personality science creates two separate personalities within the user's body. Each personality can operate a defense mode each round, but the character still is limited to one defense per personality.`,

            answer: [
                `Other than the bonuses that gnome and halfling rogues gain for their hide-in-shadows abilities, there are no rules governing the invisibility factor. Instead, the DM should work the invisibility factor into the game (or not work it in, if she so chooses). The important point is that "big folk" (humans, elves, half-elves, and even dwarves) tend not to notice gnomes and halflings in most circumstances. Obviously, a halfling dancing a jig and playing a kazoo is going to attract attention just about anywhere. But even a halfling or gnome fighter in plate armor isn't going to cause much of a stir in a crowded city street. Bystanders might remember the armored gnome or halfling, but they won't be sure exactly when she arrived or when she left. The invisibility factor is not a racial ability so much as a tool that the DM and players can use to add some spice to a campaign.`,

According to the ***PH***, the circle of power has a 30' diameter, but the ***DMG*** says the radius is five feet. The ***PH*** says the ***dispel*** ability works on hostile magic. Does this mean that friendly magic is unaffected? Is the ***dispel*** ability continuous while the sword is held? Can any magic pass through the radius?`,
            answer: [
                `Though there has yet to be any official rulings, the current thought at TSR, Inc., is as follows: The ***dispel magic*** and magic resistance powers have a five-foot radius. The magic resistance is continuous while the sword is unsheathed and held (by a paladin). ***Dispel magic*** is not continuous and must be invoked by the paladin holding the sword. Doing this counts as an action and the ***dispel*** affects all magic in the radius, hostile or not. Because the ***dispel*** is instantaneous, it usually cannot stop magic from passing though the radius—this power is most effective against in-place effects.`,
                `The magic-resistance power functions according to the rules for magic resistance in the ***PH*** and ***DMG***. Note that magic resistance comes into play only when magic can affect the protected creature. A spell that is just passing though is not affected. For example, a ***magic missile*** targeted at a creature 20' behind the paladin works normally. If the same spell is targeted at the paladin or at any other creature within five feet of the paladin, the magic resistance comes into play. Note that in some cases a spell can be blocked by default. For example, a blast from ***fireball*** affects anything within its area of effect. If a holy swords magic-resistance roll succeeds against the blast, then the blast is completely excluded from the five-foot magic-resistance radius. If the blast is rushing down a corridor at the paladin the magic resistance radius will completely block the blast if the corridor is small enough. This does not mean that a holy sword blocks all ***fireballs*** and similar effects. If, for example, a ***fireball's*** glowing missile is set to detonate outside the magic-resistance radius, the missile can explode normally, but if the magic-resistance roll succeeds, anything within the radius is protected from the blast.`

            answer: [
                `A ***combine*** spell gives a power boost to the central priest in the group using the spell. It does not grant the central priest powers or spells that would not normally be available to him. So, a druid who is the central priest in a ***combine*** spell cannot turn undead. The central priest in a ***combine*** spell can draw power from the supporting circle to enhance undead-turning or any spell that has level-based variables, such as range, damage, and duration. The spell description does not mention any special requirements for members of the circle except that they must be priests, so I'm inclined to suggest that the type of the priests in the circle does not matter. The central priest draws raw power from the circle and uses that power to enhance his own abilities. Note that while the spell description mentions only undead turning, the DM might allow any level-based granted power to be enhanced with a ***combine*** spell, provided that the power has details that vary with level. Remember that the central priest always must be the most powerful priest in the group and that ***combine*** does not grant powers that the central priest cannot normally use. A group of low-level druids, for example, cannot use ***combine*** to boost the central druid to seventh level so he can ***shape change***. Likewise, if a power is usable only a limited number of times each day, ***combine*** does not allow the central priest to exceed that limit.`,

Recently, the PCs in my game infiltrated the home of the local dictator and the party's thief made off with a ring that ultimately turned out to be worth 5,000 gp (after rolling for its value on the art objects table). The thief also took other treasures from the house. Do I have to give this character 10,000 XP?`,
            answer: [
                `A DM never *has* to give a PC any experience at all, but it's usually a good idea to do so if you want your players to come back for another game. Individual experience-point awards always are given at the DM's discretion. Some guidelines for determining when an individual award is appropriate are given on page 48, right below Table 34: Was there a reason for the character to take the action? Was there a significant risk to the character? If the answer to either question is yes, some sort of award is merited. Was the action detrimental or abusive to the other PCs? If the answer is yes, an award is not merited. If you decide to make the award, you also must decide how much experience to award; two points of experience for each gold piece worth of treasure is only a guideline. If you think it's too much, by all means reduce it. If the character in question is high level and 10,000 XP represents only a fraction of the experience requirement for the next level, you probably should award it all, especially if the character did her pilfering in a heroic manner that did not leave the rest of the PCs in the lurch. If the character is low level and 10,000 XP represents most or all the experience requirement for the next level you should give only a fraction of the 10,000 XP. You also should reduce the award of the thief who abandoned her companions in the face of danger; for example, if the thief sneaked off to rifle the bedroom while the other PCs were locked in a deadly combat with the dictator's pet owlbear, the award should be reduced or eliminated altogether. Note that if the dictator is one of the PCs' major foes, the theft might increase the story award for the group as a whole, especially if the loss interfered with some devious scheme the villain had planned.`,

            question: `Could you establish some guidelines for the chances of hitting objects? For example, what is the armor class of the broad side of a barn? Any fool ought to be able to hit it, but if you assign it an armor class of 10, a 1st-level mage has a substantial chance of missing, even from three feet away. What is the chance for hitting the bullseye of a moving target in a shooting gallery? What does it take to hit a candle's flame with a sword without disturbing the candle? How hard is it to cut straps on an opponent's armor?`,
            answer: [
                `Technically, AC 10 is the worst armor class in the game—things just don't get easier to hit than that. Note, however, that various modifiers can apply to attack rolls, even against objects. Sleeping or magically held targets, for example, are hit automatically in melee. Barns don't actually sleep, but they aren't very lively either, so melee attacks generally hit them automatically. On the other hand, if a character was trying to chop a hole through a barn wall with a dagger, I'd require a successful attack roll vs. AC 10, because all the character's blows have to land in about the same place or the character never makes a hole.`,
                `Missile attacks are a different story. I suggest giving your barn AC 10, with a +4 bonus to the attack roll for a stunned defender. (Barns are rather passive, after all.) In this situation, your 1st-level mage sure could miss an arrow shot from three feet away. I don't have a problem with this; I've seen inexperienced archers attempting to shoot and some of them really could miss the broad side of a barn. Note that in this case, a "miss" probably indicates that the character completely flubbed the shot.`,
                `Shooting gallery targets can have just about any armor class you care to assign to them. Assuming that the gallery patrons are normal humans, I'd suggest AC 8 for stationary targets that are about the size of a man's chest, AC 4 for moving targets the same size, AC 0 for smaller moving targets and AC -2 for the target that can win the shooter the big prize. Note that such targets can be made much harder to hit by increasing their speed, and by nefarious tricks such as slipping badly fletched or crooked arrows to the shooter; if adventurers show up at a shooting gallery, the owner most likely will shut the place down or do something to stack the odds in her favor.`,

In short, the most likely theory is that when conditions are right any mature beholder can give birth. A brood probably consists of 1-4 young beholders, and might require the body of a slain creature (perhaps even another beholder) to serve as an incubator. I suggest giving young beholders a minimum of 12 hit points—eight for the body, and four for the central eye. Infant beholders have a full complement of eyes.`,

            question: `Not long ago, my character had an accident with his spelljamming vessel—the reactor on his gnomish sidewheeler suffered a meltdown while in the phlogiston (and you know what that means). My character tried to steer the ship through a portal into Realmspace, but the ship blew up before it had exited the flow. The resulting explosion destroyed the ship, the portal, and a good portion of the crystal shell. (Fortunately, my character escaped via his ***amulet of the planes***.) Since the resulting hole in the crystal shell is going to allow the phlogiston to rush into Realmspace, would that mean that Toril will be consumed in flames? If so, how much experience does my character get when the entire population (barring fire-resistant creatures) is killed? (A number rounded to the nearest million would be okay.) Does the character receive any additional experience from escaping the wreck?`,
            answer: [
                `It's time for a few reminders about the properties of crystal shells:`,
                `First, all crystal shells are made of an unknown substance that is unbreakable; check out page 9 of the ***Concordance of Arcane Space*** (from the original SPELLJAMMER® boxed set), for more details. Mortals cannot destroy or alter crystal shells, except in the limited manner described in ***Concordance of Arcane Space***. Even a ***wish*** is ineffective. Exploding spelljamming ships aren't up to the job.`,
                `Second, crystal shells are so huge that the explosion in your example could not destroy a significant portion of even a small one. The Realmspace shell has an area of about 128,680,000,000,000,000,000 square miles (the planet earth, by contrast has a surface area of only 196,938,800 square miles). Even if the explosion created a fireball the size of the sun, the hole it would make would be a mere pinprick when compared with the size of the shell, The space inside a shell is so huge (*cosmically* huge) that time would end before enough phlogiston could leak in to flood the entire sphere, or even to threaten the outermost planets in the system.`,
                `Third, phlogiston does not tend to flow through holes in crystal shells. Every portal through a shell is a hole, but some barrier or phenomenon keeps the phlogiston out, though ships that locate the portal can pass through. Even if the explosion in your example "jammed" the portal open and allowed phlogiston to leak in, you'd probably just get a localized effect that looks just like a star embedded in the shell. Ships still could use the portal, provided their crews had enough nerve to dive into the heart of the star.`,
                `Finally, experience in the AD&D® game is awarded for success achieved in the face of a significant risk. Inadvertent destruction is not success, so even if your character had managed to incinerate all of Toril, he wouldn't be entitled to any experience for it. Your DM, however, might give the character a few experience points for surviving the wreck. How big the award is depends on the campaign, but it should be fairly small, 1,000 xp would be sufficient for a character rich and powerful enough to own a spelljammer.`

            answer: [
                `No, but they can come close. A flask of pure alcohol or very strong liquor would be slightly less potent, say 2d4 points of damage during the fist round, and 1d4 points the second round. (As opposed to 2d6 points of damage the first round and 1d6 points the second round for flaming oil; see ***DMG***, page 63.) Note that what appears in the AD&D game equipment list as greek fire actually is just a kind of heavy fuel oil. Real greek fire, on the other hand, was something like the ancient worlds version of napalm. From all the accounts I've read, it burned hotter and longer than plain oil. Like napalm, it also stuck to whatever it hit. Also like napalm, it was self igniting (no wick or fuse required). This nasty substance might do 3d6 points of damage the first round, 2d6 the second, and 1d6 the third round.`,

            answer: [
                `This is entirely up to the DM. Because AD&D game vampires are by definition creatures with blood-sucking fangs, it stands to reason that anyone turned into one would develop such fangs. On the other hand, there's no reason to assume that all vampires bite their victims' necks. In central European folklore, vampires drew blood from the chest. Chinese vampires have wickedly long and sharp fingernails, which serve as their primary weapons. So a vampire in the form of a toothless old man could drain its victims in any number of ways. Note that PCs might have a hard time detecting a vampire in this rather unusual form.`,

            question: `In DRAGON® issue #193, you said rolls higher than 23 were impossible when using a ***vorpal blade***. The molydeus tanar'ri carries an axe +5 that has the powers of both a ***sword of dancing*** and ***vorpal blade***. Now, if the tanar'ri rolls a natural 20, his adjusted roll would be a 25 (which is higher than 23). Does he sever the neck with that roll?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, a roll of 20 severs the neck if the attacker has a ***vorpal blade*** and the opponent has a head. I'll reiterate my main point from issue #193 for the benefit of any reader who still is in the dark about this: an attacker armed with a ***vorpal blade*** cannot sever a neck unless the attack roll is 17 or higher. This is because the modified score to sever (see item description, ***DMG***, page 186) can include only the ***vorpal blade's*** +3 bonus, not bonuses due to Strength, situation, or specialization.`,
                `Of course, the molydeus' combination ***vorpal*** and ***dancing*** weapon introduces a few problems. For example, ***swords of dancing*** have variable bonuses, which range from +1 to +4 (see item description, ***DMG***, page 185). Further, a ***sword of dancing*** can be made to dance only on a round when its bonus has fallen to +1. Does this mean the a molydeus's axe has a "dancing" cycle that is four rounds long instead of three rounds long? The DM also must decide what happens to the ***vorpal*** effect as the axe's bonus rises and falls. The simplest solution is to assume that the axe's bonus remains steady at +5, and that the axe can dance for three rounds at a time. If you take this approach, I suggest that you ignore the effect of the +5 bonus on attack scores to sever and to assume that the weapon severs a normal opponent's neck on an attack roll of 17 + , a larger-than-man-sized opponent's neck on a roll of 18 +, and a solid metal or stone opponent's neck on a roll of 19 +.`

            question: `I'm having a real problem with a few players and their wizard characters. First, I explained that a lot of iron or steel next to the skin disrupts magic. Things were fine for awhile, but now they carry plate armor with them and insist on wearing it after they have used up all their spells.`,
            answer: [
                `This is what comes from asking too many questions about a fantasy game. Fantasy, by its very nature, deals with the inexplicable and concerns itself with the what; the why is left to philosophers, science-fiction authors, and your ever helpful "Sage Advice" columnist. My first suggestion to you is to consider the obvious: If you're assuming that large masses of metal in close proximity to a wizards body foils spells, then it is relevant to ask just how your armor-toting wizards are carrying all that armor. If they've bundled it up in a pack, guess what? It's still too close.`,
                `Actually, the situation is a little more complex than that. Character-class armor and weapon restrictions are among the few basic and unalterable rules in the AD&D® game. As always, the rule is necessary because of game balance and game logic. It's been awhile since I repeated one of my little exercises in game balance and game logic, so let's go through the game logic first:`,
                `Armor is heavy, hot, and confining. Fighters gain their various combat abilities only after undergoing long and rigorous physical training that begins in their youth. (A medieval knight's training began at age six.) This explains why they can do things like slay 30 giants using swords less than four feet long, and keep on fighting even when peppered with arrows. Wearing armor is an impressive physical feat. The stuff is hot, heavy, and generally uncomfortable. It takes a long time before a person can even bear to wear it for any length of time, much less fight or explore a dungeon while encased in it. Fighters, however, develop the ability to resist physical hardships of various kinds and can soldier on through conditions that can kill other characters.`,
                `On the other hand, wizards spend their youth and all their spare time sitting and reading. This sharpens their minds, but it does not build the kind of physical skills that fighters enjoy, even in wizards who have naturally high Strength and Constitution scores. All that sitting around and studying turns wizards into sedentary bookworms who do not have enough stamina to walk around in armor. They probably can't even walk a straight line while wearing armor—a wizard in armor probably would stagger about like a little kid carrying a sack of potatoes. Further, all that studying gives wizards an entirely different mindset than fighters have. They prefer to use their brains to attack their problems; they come to regard accoutrements such as swords and armor as crude and beneath their dignity. It's not so much that wizards *can't* wear armor, but that they *won't* armor. It's too hot, too uncomfortable, too noisy, and just downright unfashionable.`,
                `Now, on to game balance: Wizards are potentially the most powerful character class in the game. They have access to a considerable array of offensive and defensive magic and can literally lay waste to whole city blocks. The price they pay for this power is an almost complete lack of physical power. In the beginning, they are so weak that they must depend on the characters around them for support and protection. Fighters, on the other hand, don't have access to a mighty arsenal of magic. All they have is their wits, their weapons, and their equipment. As the only class with unrestricted access to both weapons and armor, they are playable, but they remain so only as long as the DM does not allow other characters to poach on their territory. Otherwise, everyone in your campaign is going to be playing an armor-clad wizard.`,
                `I suggest you sock your armor-loving wizards with any or all of the following penalties:`,
                `*Encumbrance:* Even if the characters in question have high enough Strength scores to carry the weight of the armor, knock their movement rate down to one half (two-thirds if you're feeling generous). They also should make a Dexterity check every turn or fall down and go boom. It easy to lose one's equilibrium when one is carrying an unaccustomed weight, and a wizard might easily trip. The encumbered wizard also should check Dexterity every time he tries anything that even remotely requires ability: running, jumping, using stairs (in either direction), getting on a mount, etc.`,
                `*Fatigue:* Single-classed wizards who wear armor or carry shields should make a Constitution check every turn (more often if its very cold or very hot). Failure indicates fatigue. The character must remove the armor and rest awhile. If the weather is bad, the character also must do something to cool off or warm up.`,
                `*Uncertainty:* All this reliance on physical things undermines the mental discipline the wizard needs to command his magic. There is a 25% chance that any spell he casts during the next 24 hours will fail outright. (Of course, if the character is wearing prohibited armor at the time of casting, the spell fails 100% of the time.) Further, the character gains no experience for the adventure in which he dons armor to protect himself. If he makes a habit of wearing armor, he might even lose a level or two.`

            answer: [
                `Yes, the one-two punch applies to all types of opponents. When a psionicist pays the initial PSP cost for the psychic crush science, or the ego whip, id insinuation, mind thrust, or psionic blast devotions, she gets to use the power twice, provided both attacks occur in the same round and are directed against the same opponent. Note that the psionicist must make a power check for each use.`,
                `Remember that the psionicist must take the time to establish full contact (three tangents) with the opponent, even when the opponent is not using defense modes. If the psionicist uses the one-two punch against a fully contacted mind, the results vary according to the power. If the power allows a saving throw, such as psychic crush or psionic blast, the victim must save each vs. each successful use of the power and suffers accordingly if the save fails. If the power does not allow a saving throw, two successes in the same round are not cumulative; however, the psionicist gets to use the best of the two results. For example, if the one-two punch delivers two successful uses of the id insinuation devotion, the psionicist would roll twice to see how long the opponent would remain in a moral uproar and only the highest roll would count (though the DM might let the psionicist might let the psionicist choose which roll to take).`

            answer: [
                `***Contingency*** and ***chain contingency*** spells trigger other spells. Psionics are not spells and cannot be part of a magical ***contingency***. Likewise, ***contingency*** cannot be used to trigger magical items, breath weapons, gaze attacks, or spell-like abilities.`,
                `Under some conditions, it might be possible to use a ***ring of telekinesis*** and psionic telekinesis together, but this wouldn't happen very often. If faced with an object too big to lift with the telekinesis power, a psionicist wouldn't benefit from a ***ring of telekinesis*** because he couldn't initiate the power and concentrate on using the ring at the same time. If, however, the psionicist were already moving an object and was merely maintaining the telekinesis power, he could use the ring's lifting capacity to reduce the maintenance cost. Likewise, if the object were a table and an opponent grabbed it or jumped on it, the ring could be brought into play to handle the additional weight. I suppose that a lenient DM might allow a psionicist to establish a partial "pull" on a large object, for example, spending 80 PSPs to tug at a 100-pound object, and then use a ***ring of telekinesis*** during the next round to provide the extra power. (In this case, the total PSP cost would be 120 PSPs, 80 to initiate the power, and 40 more to maintain the power on the second round vs. 150 PSPs to move the object with the telekinesis power alone).`

Because ***mind blank*** is an eighth-level spell, I suggest that you require a save each time a psionic uses a power against a protected character—the spell presents a formidable barrier that does not weaken even if the psionicist already has breached a few times. Note that bonuses from defensive items, such as ***rings of protection***, do not modify this save. Wisdom bonuses can apply if the DM allows them to.`,

            answer: [
                `Assuming that the party already knows where a trap is, the thief find-traps ability is already pretty much irrelevant. There is no hard and fast rule for non-thieves disarming traps by triggering them. First, the DM has to decide if a trap can be disarmed at all. There's not much anybody can do with a 10-foot pit. Then there are traps such as tripwires, that can be triggered safely as long as the character messing with it has enough reach to stay out of the way (or course, the trap might be loaded with multiple shots). Then there are traps that non-thieves might be able to disarm, such as poison needles in locks, scything blades, and the like. Any character who correctly guesses the trap's workings could have some chance to break it (by bending the needle, wedging the blade, etc.). It is best to decide the chance for success ahead of time; thieves with the remove-traps skill should get a substaneial bonus. It is also fine to salt your dungeons with a few traps that can be foiled only by thieves or utter destruction. (No matter how flexible a poison needle is, it won't work after the mage has blown the door it guards to flinders with a ***lightning bolt***.)`,

            question: `What's to prevent players from using the ***enhance*** spell from ***Legends & Lore*** to circumvent the limits on using wishes to increase ability scores? ***Wishes*** cannot raise ability scores over 16, but ***enhance*** can raise a score to 22. The wizard casting ***enhance*** loses a few points of Constitution, but ***wishes*** can be used to restore the loss. Isn't the ***enhance*** spell overpowered?`,
            answer: [
                `There's nothing in the rules to prevent PCs from doing what you've described. Note that this spell is intended for NPCs; most campaigns don't have wizard PCs of 16th level or higher running around. No matter how powerful the PCs are, most NPC wizards are not going to cast this spell for the PCs. The ***enhance*** spell-caster is going to need at least two—and possibly five or more—***wishes*** to recover lost Constitution points from each spell. If the PCs in your game have access to that many ***wishes***, you should be glad that the worst thing you have to deal with is PCs running around with ability scores of 22. Even if the PCs are using this spell themselves, the one-week rest period required after each ***enhance*** spell and the three years of magical aging for each ***wish*** spell should put the kibosh on the whole deal sooner or later. Even if you've done something silly, such as let the PCs circumvent the magical aging, a few evil NPCs and monsters showing up whenever an ***enhance*** spell goes off while the party wizard is incapacitated should persuade the PCs to find a new scam. Note also that ***wishes*** can raise an ability score higher than 16; it just takes 10 ***wishes*** to improve the ability score one point if it is higher than 16 but less than 20. If the ability score is 21 or higher it takes 20 ***wishes*** to increase the score one point (see ***DMG***, pages 11-12).`,
                `If you still feel the ***enhance*** spell is a problem, don't let your PCs have the spell—you don't have to use a spell in your campaign just because it appears in a rule book.`

"None" means the spell has no saving throw; barring magic resistance and other special protections, the spell always works on the subject. "½" means the spell works at half strength if the subject makes a saving throw; damage-inflicting spells such as ***fireball*** generally have this kind of saving throw. "Special" means that the saving throw is unusual in some way and not easily summarized. The type of saving throw might vary according to the conditions under which the spell is cast, or the saving throw might depend on the type of subject, a specific action on the subject's part, or an ability check.

Page 83 of ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook*** says ***invisibility*** is an illusion and the invisible character can always see himself because he disbelieves the illusion. Which book is correct? If ***invisibility*** is an illusion, do beings with Intelligence scores of 20 or higher automatically see invisible creatures because they are immune to first- and second-level illusions? Can an *invisible* spell-caster cast a spell from a scroll, or is the scroll also invisible because it is on the character's person? If a creature makes a successful save to notice an *invisible* creature, does it actually see creature well enough to know what it looks like or does it just have a very good idea of where the *invisible* creature is?`,
            answer: [
                `The ***DMG*** is correct. Generally, the most recently published material takes precedence over older material, but in this case the ***Complete Wizard's Handbook*** is wrong. Note that not all Illusion/Phantasm spells can be disbelieved. Spells that have no saving throw, or that are negated by a normal saving throw, such as ***invisibility***, ***hypnotic pattern***, and ***mirror image***, do not use the disbelief procedures.`,
                `The ***invisibility*** spell is an illusion; as such, creatures with 20 + Intelligence scores are immune to it. Such creatures also are immune to spells such as ***mirror image***, ***blindness***. This does not, however, mean that these creatures automatically see every *invisible* creature in the AD&D universe. Naturally invisible creatures such as invisible stalkers, aerial servants, and pixies are still hidden from supra-genius creatures. The DM also might rule that magical ***invisibility*** bestowed by items such as ***dust of disappearance***, ***cloaks of elvenkind***, and maybe even ***rings of invisibility*** also work in the face of supra-genius intelligence by virtue of the magical power invested in them.`,
                `When a character becomes *invisible*, all her equipment becomes invisible with her The character could read a scroll, however by putting down the scroll and allowing it to become visible (see the ***invisibility*** spell description in the ***PH***, page 142). The character can pick up the visible scroll and read it normally, and can make the scroll *invisible* again by tucking it into her clothing. I strongly suggest that you assume nonmagical invisibility detection merely reveals an invisible creature's outline and position. The viewer has a good idea of the creature's size and shape, and the viewer knows exactly where the creature is—well enough to attack the creature with spells and to make physical attacks without the usual -4 penalty.`

            question: `What player in his right mind would choose the sha'ir kit for wizards in the AL-QADIM® setting? The incredible restrictions of their spellcasting abilities and their inability to create magical items make them an absurd kit for an adventuring wizard. Based on what I can make of their gen-related abilities, it could conceivably take a sha'ir as long to cast a simple ***cantrip*** as it would to cast a ***fireball***. Beyond that, a sha'ir might not even be able to cast a critically needed spell at the right time because the sha'ir's gen might be delayed in getting it and might not get it at all.`,
            answer: [
                `To answer your first question, any player with a smidgen of imagination and wit should consider a sha'ir, unless she has no interest in playing a spell-casting character. Apart from a few minor technical errors, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of the sha'ir's weaknesses. A sha'ir casts spells in the same amount of time as by Skip Williams any other wizard does, (***Cantrip*** has an initiative modifier of 1, slightly faster than a ***fireball's*** initiative modifier of 3.) Most sha'irs can get ***cantrip*** from their gens more quickly than they can get ***fireball***; sha'irs of 5th level or higher must wait 1d6 + 1 rounds for the first-level ***cantrip*** and 1d6 + 3 rounds for the third-level ***fireball***. Note that sha'irs of 4th level or less must wait 1d6 + 3 turns for a ***fireball*** and there is a very good chance that their gens will return empty handed; the time is measured in turns because a normal AD&D game wizard of the sha'ir's level could not normally cast the spell (see the ***Arabian Adventures*** book, page 98). Note that a sha'ir who has acquired and cast a ***cantrip*** spell can freely create minor spell effects for as long as the spell lasts (one hour per caster level) just as any other wizard can—the gen doesn't have to go and get each individual effect.`,
                `The sha'ir has other advantages that make the kit very attractive to thoughtful players of any persuasion. Role-players should jump at the chance to play out the relationship between a sha'ir and his gen. Encounters with merchants are likely to take on a new flavor if the party sha'ir recognizes genie craftsmanship in the goods offered for sale. As the sha'ir rises in level, the player can look forward to forging alliances with genies of all sorts; constructing a genie prison and negotiating terms with the genie who is to occupy it would be a noteworthy event in any campaign.`,
                `Power gamers should absolutely drool over a sha'ir. (Boy, I can hear the howls of protest even as I type this, so don't bother writing in, just read on.) I haven't forgotten your objection to the delay sha'irs must endure once they've sent their gens to get spells. Frankly, this isn't a terrible problem for any player who has gotten beyond the ***fireball***-everything-that-moves theory of play.`,
                `Consider this: A sha'ir never runs out of spells. It is true that many encounters will be over before a sha'ir's gen can bring even a first-level spell. But PC wizards who are in the habit of tossing out spells every melee round are going run out of spells sooner or later—probably sooner. Once a standard wizard's allotment of spells are gone, the character has very little to contribute to the adventure unless he has a wand, staff, scroll, or other magical item that can produce spell-like effects.`,
                `A sha'ir's ability to keep sending his gen for an unending supply of spells is incredibly potent. A 5th-level mage can carry only seven spells at time (4 first-, 2 second-, and 1 third-level spell); that means he has only seven rounds of ammunition when a fight starts. If the character casts preparatory spells on himself, such as ***shield***, ***strength***, and ***detect invisibility***, nearly half his arsenal is gone. Truly useful but unspectacular spells such as ***fly*** and ***haste*** come at the cost of the character's one "big gun," ***fireball*** or ***lightning bolt***. Now consider a 5th-level sha'ir; all he needs is a little time and he can cast a ***strength*** spell on every fighter in the party. He also can make everybody ***fly***. Then, he can cast a ***shield***, and a ***detect invisibility*** on himself. Later, if the party needs ***knock*** or a ***detect magic***, spell the gen can just go get them. The sha'ir might not be able to pour in the firepower during a fight, but he can prepare for a fight by sending his gen out for a potent spell, such as ***fireball***, ahead of time. If the sha'ir doesn't cast the spell right away, he can hold it for up to 30 minutes before using it. In this manner, he can pretty much always have one spell ready to cast.`,
                `The sha'ir's bag of tricks still isn't exhausted. If he's willing to wait a few turns, he can try for a fourth- or fifth-level spell such as ***polymorph self***, ***fire shield***, or ***teleport***. The spell might not ever arrive, but most players will admit that it's nice to have a chance to get it. Also note that sha'irs can use any magical item a wizard can use, so a sha'ir can fall back on scrolls, wands, and the like while the gen is away, just as a normal wizard does when the spells run out.`,
                `In any case, players do not have to be out of their minds to play sha'irs, but they do have to be willing to use their heads.`

Vampires can regenerate, and regain hit points fairly quickly. Other undead can recover hit points by resting, just like living creatures do (probably by absorbing negative energy and using it to reconstruct their bodies). The DM is free to decide how quickly hit points are recovered, but I suggest a maximum of one hit point every 24 hours. Note that healing spells do not work on non-living creatures, as "Sage Advice" pointed out last month. I strongly suggest you extend this limitation to include ***potions of healing***, ***Keoghtom's ointment***, and similar items. The DM might, however, introduce spells and items that can heal the undead; such items probably would be very dangerous to the living.`,

                `Before somebody asks, a spectre rendered powerless by daylight can only move. It cannot attack or drain levels. Because it hates light so much, a spectre must try to move to a dark place; it can't go joyriding in the sunlight.`

If a lich casts enough ***wish*** spells, it eventually "dies" and falls into dust. Note also that casting a ***wish*** spell forces the character to rest in bed for 2d4 days. A lich must rest in its tomb for the required time after casting a ***wish***. Because this leaves the lich vulnerable to attack, I doubt that liches cast ***wish*** spells very often.`,
                `Because liches once were living characters, it's a good bet that they have a Constitution score, which is determined by rolling 3d6 or whatever method the campaign employs. The DM is free to decide what effect the lich's transformation into an undead creature has on the Constitution score. It might be reduced (dead people are not at all well), or it might be increased (dead creatures can pretty much ignore injuries that would imperil a living creature, and they don't have to worry about getting sick).

I'd hold the additions down to one new weapon for druids, maybe two if a PC druid from your game actually visited Athas and came back home to tell the tale. Looking over the three weapons on your list, I'm inclined to eliminate cahulaks first because they are the most unlike the weapons already on the druids list. The bard's friend seems to be something like a dagger, albeit more complicated. There's no reason druids couldn't use metal versions of this weapon; they're allowed to use metal daggers and scimitars after all. I have doubts about tortoise blades. Essentially, a tortoise blade is a combination weapon and shield, which doesn't strike me as very druidical.

            question: `Do planar PCs in the PLANESCAPE setting really have the ability to see portals? I can find only one reference to the ability and everything I read about portals suggest that they are inconspicuous and not noticeable without magic. What would a planar "see" that would identify a portal?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, planars really can see portals. According to page 9 of ***A Player's Guide to the Planes***, a planar sees a glowing outline when she looks at a portal. Common sense (and game balance) suggests a few limitations: A gate or portal must be active to show an outline; if a temporary or shifting portal is not active when a character looks at it there is no outline and there is no way to tell just by looking that there might be portal there sometime in the future. The outlines don't glow like neon signs; it takes a long, careful look to discover one. I suggest one turn to search a 10' x 10' area for outlines. No die roll is required—if a planer looks in the right place she finds the portal—but the character must make a special effort. Note that ***true seeing*** and ***warp sense*** spells make portals stand out, which makes finding them a lot quicker. Note also that planars can't tell where a portal leads just by looking at it.`,

            question: `The ***DMG*** says that flying creatures have a daily movement rate in miles equal to twice their flying speed if the air is calm. The world map in the new COUNCIL OF WYRMS™ setting has a scale of 50 miles per hex. Most dragons have a flying rate of 30, so they can fly a little more than one hex a day. How can the dragons in this world ever answer a call to council in the required 15 days?`,
            answer: [
                `I was party to a discussion of this very problem while the COUNCIL OF WYRMS box was in production. The solution goes something like this: The movement rate in the ***DMG*** assumes a 10-hour day at a moderate pace with stops for food and rest. Dragons, being fantastically strong fliers, can stay aloft for 20 hours a day with no stops at all. This yields a daily movement rate of 10 times the basic move, or six hexes a day for a dragon with a flying speed of 30. That's more than enough to allow any dragon to reach the Council Aerie in 15 days no matter where it starts on the map. An oversight caused this solution to be excluded from the final version of the manuscript.`,
                `I suggest you treat this kind of extended dragon flight as a type of forced march (see ***PH***, page 120). Note that dragons can fly five times their basic movement rate in miles per day (three hexes for a dragon with a flight speed of 30) and avoid the daily Constitution check. You should assume that the oceans surrounding the Io's Blood island chain are dotted with landing places too small to appear on the map. Any dragons can pause at one of these for a quick nap and snack whenever the need arises. I suggest that you allow a dragon who is trying to answer a summons to council to ignore one failed saving throw during the trip for each age category it has. After the flight ends, a dragon must sleep one day for each day of extended flying, plus one week (15 days in a dragon's reckoning) for each failed saving throw. The dragon can postpone the sleep for one week per age category, which should allow it to attend all the council before it has to doze off.`

                `I enjoy "Sage Advice" very much, but I feel I must reply to some of issue #204's letters myself. First you claimed that beholders procreate by means of parthenogenesis. However, on page 69 of the ***Lorebook of the Void*** in the SPELLJAMMER® boxed set very clear reference is made to a beholder "hive mother" or ultimate beholder; this implies a gender distinction. Also, you pointed out all the errors in the letter about the exploding gnomish sidewheeler except the most glaring one: an ***amulet of the planes*** won't work in the Flow because alternate planes are inaccessible. The character, far from gaining 1,000 xp, should be radioactive toast. You shouldn't get soft on character death through stupidity just because you're writing for the April issue.`,
                `By the way, can the Mists of Ravenloft reach into the Flow even though access to other planes is restricted?`
            ],
            answer: [
                `I "claim" nothing about beholders. In issue #204 I merely pointed out what the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL*** tome says about beholder reproduction (see page 22). The ***MM*** material is only speculation, the exact nature of beholder reproduction is unrevealed. In any case, your single line from ***Lorebook of the Void*** hardly disproves the parthenogenetic reproduction theory. In fact a "hive mother" is not a female beholder, but a type of beholder-kin (see ***MM***, page 25). Note that the term "hive mother" doesn't necessarily imply that beholders have genders—it's just a name. George Washington is known as the father of our country, but that does not mean that he and Martha are still having bambinos. Also note that any parthenogenetic creature could literally be a "mother" because it is capable of producing offspring. Such a creature is not female in the traditional sense of the term because it reproduces without assistance or interference from others of its kind.`,
                `Regarding exploding gnomish sidewheelers: I'm sorry, I think overlooking a crystal sphere's sheer size and volume is the most glaring error here. As far as escaping via an ***amulet of the planes***, you are right, the amulet shouldn't work in the Flow any more than a ***plane shift*** or similar spell would. But, the sidewheeler was exiting the Flow at the time of the explosion. I have you at a slight disadvantage, because the edited version of the letter didn't make that altogether clear. So, while the ship wasn't exactly in Wildspace, it wasn't really in the Flow either. More importantly, I think it's a very bad idea for a DM to reverse a decision that allowed a player character to survive a bad situation. Campaigns begin to crumble when players are jumping for joy over a miraculous escape and the DM poops the party by telling them their characters are dead after all. It would have been fine for the DM to warn the player never to count on saving his gnome from explosions in the Flow via an ***amulet of the planes*** again, but the ruling should be allowed to stand— lucky flukes happen to PCs from time to time—that's why they're heroes.`,
                `I'm inclined to think that the Mists of Ravenloft do not extend into the Flow. Characters who commit despicable acts are not necessarily safe, however. The Dark Powers are canny, and the Mists could be waiting for evildoers upon their return to Wildspace.`

If, on the other hand, one were to find a petitioner's mortal remains, one can use ***speak with dead*** on them and get a normal result, provided that the creature has not been dead longer than the spell allows. A ***speak with dead*** spell doesn't give the caster a hotline to the petitioner (as you point out, that would be useless). Instead, ***speak with dead*** is a divination spell that allows the caster to learn things that a particular dead creature knew in life. Exactly how this works is unrevealed, but it a pretty good bet that petitioners have nothing to do with the process.

When a creature detects the scrying, it detects this sensor. When a ***dispel magic*** spell is used to disrupt scrying, the sensor is the spell's target. The sensor always appears in a location that gives an unobstructed view of the subject. The DM can decide how far away from the subject the sensor will be, but it should be close enough to allow the viewer to see details, say 5-30' distant. Assume the view is similar to a closely focused photograph; the viewer can see the subject and any creature or object in its immediate vicinity. The view behind the subject is murky and indistinct.

                `Sigil is literally as big as the DM wants it to be. According to recent reports, the Harmonium has measured Sigil's width (the distance from one outer edge of the ring to the other) at five miles and its circumference at 40 miles, which gives the ring a diameter of a little more than 12.72 miles. Note, however that Sigil is a world unto itself and although it is finite, its size is not fixed. The Lady of Pain can enlarge and reduce it to accommodate newcomers and to force out folk who displease her. Its a good bet that Sigil gets a little smaller whenever some poor berk winds up in the mazes. In any case, I don't recommend making Sigil any narrower than five miles or any wider than 20 miles.`,

            answer: [
                `Generally, a gen can go fetch spells for its master from any place in the multiverse. The gen's starting location has no measurable effect on how long it takes to fetch a spell, because most of the gen's time is spent locating and negotiating for the spell, not actually traveling from place to place. The DM can rule that local conditions prevent the gen from leaving the plane, but this should be very rare. If the plane the gen is on allows access to the Ethereal or Astral Planes, it always can fetch spells. Even when it cannot directly enter the Astral or Ethereal, the gen probably can find a conduit or gate that will get it where it needs to go. Note that a gen's ability to go plane hopping does not apply to the sha'ir or to the sha'ir's companions.`,

Taking the items from your example: a golem can walk through most layers of a ***prismatic sphere*** and suffer no damage or special effects, but the violet (force field) layer stops the golem. The ***Bigby's hand*** spells cannot damage golems, but they can slow them or move them around if the golem falls within the spells weight limits. ***Mordenkainen's sword*** is ineffective against golems. Note that other spells might have strange effects when golems are involved. For example, a ***transmute rock to mud*** spell cast under a golem's feet probably will cause the golem to sink into the mud, The golem, however, will not drown. Instead it sinks to the bottom and keeps right on moving, eventually climbing out. If the spell is dispelled or reversed, the golem eventually will smash its way out of the resulting rock.`,

            answer: [
                `The penalties for being ambushed (no chance for a return attack *and* roll for surprise to see if the ambusher gets a another free round of attacks with surprise) do not always apply to the victim of a thief's backstab attack. To qualify as an ambush, the ambusher must be aware of her victim and prepare her attack ahead of time. In addition, the target must be unable to detect the foe prior to the attack. For example, a thief who hears a monster approaching, successfully hides in shadows until the monster passes, then successfully moves silently and closes to the attack probably deserves to be credited with an ambush. On the other hand, a thief who turns a corner and finds herself facing an opponent's unguarded back should be allowed to make a backstab attack, but cannot stage an ambush.`,
                `Technically, a thief must surprise an opponent before she can claim any backstab bonuses (see ***PHB***, page 40); that is, the backstab *requires* surprise, it does not guarantee it. Note that an unseen thief who makes a successful move silently roll has an extra chance to achieve surprise, see ***DMG***, table 57, page 102; the target should suffer a -2 penalty for the thief's silent movement and very likely an additional -2 for not seeing the thief lurking behind.`,
                `In any case, most DMs I know dispense with the surprise roll and allow a backstab anytime a thief makes an attack from behind against an opponent who is unaware of the thief and has no compelling reason to suspect a rear attack. In such cases, I still recommend a normal surprise roll. If the victim is surprised, the thief gets two attacks before there is an initiative roll. The thief's first attack gains the backstab bonuses and the second attack is a normal rear attack. If the surprise roll fails, the thief is assumed to win initiative and gets the backstab bonuses for the first attack and the victim and turn around and return the attack if she survives.`

Now, I don't find anything in the ***charm person***, ***charm person or mammal***, ***suggestion***, ***mass charm***, ***fire charm***, or ***charm monster*** spell descriptions implying that any of these spells do not produce magical emanations just like any other spell does.`,
                `Let's pause for a moment, however, and examine what ***detect magic*** can and cannot do. ***Detect magic*** can detect magical emanations from a charmed creature. If a priest casts the spell, all it reveals is the approximate strength magic, weak to overwhelming; the priest who cast the spell learns nothing else. If a wizard casts the ***detect magic*** spell, there is a 10% chance per caster level of identifying the exact type of magic; in this case, Enchantment/Charm magic, not ***charm person*** or any other specific effect. Note that this kind of accuracy is not always possible. The percentile roll to determine the type of magic can fail and the DM can rule that there are so many conflicting types of magic present that no one of them can be singled out. This might very well be the case if the charmed character also is carrying several magical items, has consumed a potion, and has also has received some other type of spell.`,

First, it allows priests to identify magical charms when they find them; something that their version of ***detect magic*** cannot do. Second, it allows a magical charm to be identified exactly, right down to the specific type—it can distinguish a ***charm person*** effect from a ***rod of beguiling*** effect even when there are several different types of magic affecting the creature being examined; something that not even the wizard's version of ***detect magic*** can do.

The creature also loses all sense of personal initiative and does nothing unless the caster tells it to do something (see DMG, pages 63-64). It is possible for the caster to persuade the *charmed* creature to attack former comrades, but the caster's intention must be clear and the caster might need to be very insistent if the *charmed* creature is lawful or good and is loyal to its original group. Such communication is seldom possible in the midst of combat, though the caster can draw the *charmed* creature aside for a chat.

A bandolier over a man-sized character's torso can hold about three size S weapons, and a character who really wants to be armed to the teeth probably can carry two or three very compact size S weapons, such as daggers, strapped to each leg (bulkier weapons such as short swords and war hammers can't be this way if the character wants to walk normally).`,

Bonuses from a ***potion of giant strength*** are never added into this bonanza of combat bonuses (a potion being neither girdle nor gauntlet, nor normal). Note that a character must have all three items, girdle, gauntlets, and war hammer, to get the super bonus. So, if the DM only give out two of three items, no PC in the game can get the combined bonuses.`,
                `Are the combined bonuses scary? Well, scary is a relative term. Even your +9/+16 tactical nuke on legs is likely to take pause if she meets something that just doesn't care about how much damage an opponent can inflict. A vampire wizard using a ***fire shield*** spell might just ruin the tactical nuke's day, even if the vampire only gets to stick around for a round or two before being forced into gaseous form or being turned by the party priest.`,
                `In case you're not quite following me here, remember that vampires just don't care much about damage that doesn't come in the form of sharpened stakes in the heart; other forms of damage just force them into gaseous form until they can regenerate the damage. Also remember that ***fire shield*** spells turn physical attacks into magical zaps that inflict just as much damage on the attacker as the attacker inflicts on the target. So every time the character hits for mega-damage she also suffers mega-damage.`,
                `No, to really "scare" me you'd have to add a ***ring of vampiric regeneration***, ***armor of etherealness***, and a ***cloak of displacement*** to the tactical nuke. Now there's a character that could make the tarrasque think about retiring and taking up collectible card games.`,
                `The moral of the story is DMs should be careful when handing out magical treasures, especially ***girdles of giant strength*** and magical war hammers (even ***war hammers +1***). If you find that your players have used their characters' magical items to create killing machines that really scare you, it's time to start thinking about what might scare the killing machines. (What would happen to the PCs if the spell-casting vampire had two or three *hasted* pet rust monsters and had dropped a few ***phase door*** spells in strategic locations?)`

            question: `Wizards using the ghul lord kit from the ***Complete Sha'ir's Handbook*** have an ability called manipulation, which inflicts temporary damage on the user. What is temporary damage? Also, there is a reference to a process called "leaching" that allows the character to use magical items to avoid the hit point loss, but leaching is never explained.`,
            answer: [
                `The damage a ghul lord suffers from a manipulation comes from the negative energy the character uses to power the manipulation. It is temporary only insofar as it can be healed by rest or spells—the character does not lose hit points permanently.`,
                `Leaching is a complete mystery to me, but here's a suggestion: Defensive items, such as ***rings of protection***, ***cloaks or protection***, and ***bracers of defense***, can block the damage. Each of an item's plusses stops one point of damage; ***bracers of defense*** have one effective plus for each point of armor class improvement they bestow beyond armor class 10, so, for example, ***bracers of defense AC 4*** count as +6 items. A ghul lord carrying several defensive items can choose which one to leach during any particular manipulation. If the manipulation is particularly powerful, the ghul lord can leach multiple items to block all the damage. A leached magical item becomes nonmagical for 1d4 melee rounds no matter how much damage it blocked. Each time an item is leached, it must save vs. magical fire or be destroyed in a wave of negative energy.`

            question: `Exactly how does a wizard using the Mystic of Nog kit (from the ***CSH***) sacrifice spell levels when maintaining the *hands of stone* power? I understand that the character must devote one spell level to the power each time he advances a level, but the kit description says that spells have to be expended in whole spell units, you can't spend part of a 3rd-level spell to get a power that costs only one or two spell levels. So, only a 1st level spell slot can be used to maintain *hands of stone*. What happens to a Mystic of Nog when he gains a level and does not also gain a 1st-level spell slot? Also, the kit description mentions that an ability score can be raised higher than 18 temporarily. How long does the temporary increase last and how does the character pay for it?`,
            answer: [
                `If a Mystic of Nog character doesn't have a 1st-level spell slot available to spend on maintaining the *hands of stone* power, he can't maintain the power and suffers the consequences (1d6 points of damage to the character every time he uses *hands of stone*). Players who choose this power for their characters should plan ahead and make sure that sufficient 1st level spell slots are available. If the DM is feeling kind, the PC may use the power at a lower level if the maintenance cost can't be paid. For example, an 8th-level Mystic of Nog inflicts 1d4 +4 hp damage with *hands of stone* (1d4 + half the character's level, rounded up). If the character advances to 9th level, he could inflict 1d4 + 5 hp damage. If the character cannot maintain the power, the DM might allow him to inflict 1d4 + 4 hp damage with no damage to himself. If the DM was feeling really kind, he might allow the character to delay the maintenance cost for several levels and make up the deficit with a higher level spell slot. For instance, the character from the previous example might not pay any maintenance for his *hands of stone* power until he reaches, say, 11th level. Under the suggested rule, his *hands of stone* power still would inflict 1d4 +4 hp damage, but if he sacrificed a 3rd-level spell slot upon reaching 11th level the ability would be properly maintained and would inflict 1d4 + 6 hp damage.`,
                `I recommend that temporarily increasing an ability score above 18 cost five spell levels per point of increase. The spell levels should be taken from the slots the character normally has available for casting spells and are not lost permanently. The increase lasts one day or until the character rests and studies spells again.`

            answer: [
                `Most proficiencies require a check against a relevant ability score if the DM decides there is a chance of failure. Speaking a language can require a check against the PC's unmodified Intelligence score (see ***PHB***, Table 37). Deciding whether a proficiency requires a success roll always is a judgment call on the DM's part. In the case of a language, no check is required when native speakers are conversing. If the circumstances are difficult, such as when a non-native speaker first hears an unfamiliar dialect or a character has to do some fast talking in a non-native language, the DM might call for a success roll to determine whether the speaker stumbles over a phrase or otherwise misspeaks. A success roll might also be required when a non-native speaker tries to get vital information out of a native speaker who is excited or distracted (did he say run to the back or the runt is back?).`,

            question: `According to ***The Book of Artifacts*** (page 124), a wizard needs a ***permanency*** spell and an ***enchant an item*** spell to create a permanent magical item. Because the ***permanency*** spell is 8th level, a wizard with an Intelligence score of 15 or less cannot learn it (see ***PHB***, Table 4) and cannot make permanent magical items. Is that right? Also, if the wizard were a half-elf, the character would have to have a 19 Intelligence or he could not reach 16th level, which is the first level in which a wizard can learn an 8th level spell. Right? Finally, if the wizard is an abjurer, invoker, or necromancer, the character cannot make permanent magical items because one of the two required spells falls in the character's opposition schools. (Abjurers cannot learn ***permanency***, an alteration; and invokers and necromancers cannot learn ***enchant an item***, an enchantment/charm.)`,
            answer: [
                `You are almost right on all three counts.`,
                `Yes, a wizard needs both an ***enchant an item*** and a ***permanency*** spell to create a permanent magical item.`,
                `Yes, a wizard must be at least 16th level to learn and cast ***permanency***, which is an 8th-level spell available only to wizards with Intelligence scores of 16 or higher and access to the alteration school.

                `Yes, a half-elf wizard needs an Intelligence score of 19 or more to reach 16th level (if the campaign is using the Exceeding Level Limits optional rule).`,
                `But no rule says a character who is creating a magical item has to cast all the required spells himself. The character can get another character to cast the spells for him, read the spells from scrolls, or use a ***wish*** to duplicate a spell's effects. Remember that any wizard can read wizard spells from scrolls, even spells from a specialist's opposition schools. (This a special property of magical scrolls and an important exception to the general rule that prevents specialists from employing magical items that produce effects from their opposition schools.) Also, "Sage Advice" suggested last month that it's okay to add ***enchant an item*** to the evocation/invocation school. You can use the same logic to put ***permanency*** into the evocation/invocation school, too, but that's beginning to stretch things a bit.`,

            question: `The item description for a ***vorpal blade*** says the sword can sever the head of a larger-than-man-sized opponent on a modified roll of 21-23. Now, in the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL™*** tome there is a size category for creatures called "larger than man-sized," covering creatures 7'-12' tall. The players in my game were very annoyed when I ruled that their ***vorpal blade*** could not sever the heads of huge or gargantuan opponents such as dragons. My players argue that the sword can sever any creature's head, and that the number to sever the head of any creature larger than a man is 21-23. I contend that the sword can't sever the heads of creatures more than 12' tall. I don't think that a 3' sword ought to be able to slice the head off a creature with a neck 10' thick.`,
            answer: [
                `Technically, your players are right. The phrase "larger than man-sized" in the item description refers to any creature bigger than a normal human, not just size Large creatures. This kind of usage is common throughout the game. For example, most weapons have two damage ratings, one for small or man-sized opponents and one for larger opponents. In this case, "small or man-sized" refers to size Tiny, Small, and Man-sized creatures; "larger" refers to size Large, Huge, and Gargantuan creatures.`,
                `Nevertheless, you are free to employ whatever house rules you think are reasonable. For example, if one reads the rules literally, a character armed with a ***vorpal blade*** and standing in a pit could behead a storm giant standing on the floor outside the pit—even if all the character could reach was the giant's big toe. Does that seem silly or illogical? I think so. On the other hand, magic does not have to be reasonable or logical.`,
                `Magic is fantastic and can bring about all kinds of effects without any logical physical causes—a spell that can turn a griffon into a goldfish isn't at all logical. It may be that when a ***vorpal blade*** severs a neck there is a brilliant magical flash and a cloud of smoke. When the smoke clears, there's the opponent's head lying on the ground; the sword might not even be bloodstained. And there's nothing wrong with that if that is the kind of game you want to run.`,
                `I suggest, however, that you allow ***vorpal blades*** to sever any opponent's neck only when there is a reasonable chance that a blow from the sword could touch the opponent's neck at some time during the melee round. For example, if a character hacks at the tip of a sleeping dragon's tail, the creature's head is many feet away, and there is no chance to sever its neck. On the other hand, if the dragon is trying to bite the character wielding the ***vorpal blade*** its neck is within reach at least some of the time. Remember that combat in the AD&D game is abstract; a ***vorpal blade*** doesn't necessarily cleave off a creature's head in a single blow. The character might strike the target's neck several times during the course of the round. Or perhaps the sword does strike off a head with a single swipe—there's nothing that says that a ***vorpal blade*** can't temporarily grow to an enormous length to get the job done or that it can't emit a plane of magical force that does the really heavy duty cutting.`

            question: `The ***Complete Book of Humanoids*** allows some pretty large creatures to become thieves (voadkyns, minotaurs, and hornhead saurials). Can these creatures backstab man-sized opponents? What weapons can they use when backstabbing? Are there any penalties when they move silently or hide in shadows?`,
            answer: [
                `Humanoid thieves certainly can backstab man-sized opponents, but some restrictions apply. Being smaller than an opponent can interfere with backstabbing because the thief can't always reach a vital area; this is seldom a problem if the thief is bigger than the opponent. Like any other thief, a humanoid thief must weild a melee weapon from the thief weapon list (club, dagger, knife, broad sword, long sword, short sword, or staff) when backstabbing.`,
                `Table 14 from the ***Complete Book of Humanoids*** gives racial adjustments for all thief skills. Most of the larger races have no modifiers to the move silently ability, and several actually get bonuses to the hide in shadows ability—thief abilities are the products of skill and training, not size. However, large creatures's size might be a handicap in some situations. For example, a minotaur might have a hard time moving silently through a forest where its head brushes against overhanging branches. The DM must handle these situations on a case-by-case basis.`

            question: `Your answer to the question about elven archers in issue #215 was helpful, but I have a few more questions. The rules say that the elven archer can choose only long sword, short sword, and dagger as melee weapons at the start. Does the - 1 attack penalty apply to these weapons? Does the - 1 attack penalty apply to these weapons if they are not chosen until later in the archer's career (such as at 3rd level when the PC gains another weapon proficiency)? The rules also say that elven archers don't get attack bonuses when using melee weapons. Does this include bonuses from magical weapons? Artifact weapons? Weapons of quality? Do archers get damage bonuses from high Strength scores or magic? Can an archer specialize in a melee weapon to get the extra attacks and maybe the damage bonus?`,
            answer: [
                `Reading the kit description strictly, I'm inclined to suggest that an elven archer suffers a - 1 attack penalty with any melee weapon he chooses as part of his initial weapon selection, which is limited to the three weapons listed above. Attack bonuses from a high Strength score are not negated, but the - 1 penalty applies. Damage bonuses of any kind are never affected. So an archer with a Strength score of 18/51 wielding a long sword has a + 2 attack bonus and a + 3 damage bonus. (The PC gains + 1 for an elf attacking with a sword, a + 2 attack bonus for Strength, and the - 1 attack penalty for an archer using a melee weapon; the PC also gains the standard + 3 damage bonus due to his Strength).`,
                `When using any melee weapon other than a long sword, short sword, or dagger, an archer loses all attack bonuses from Strength and race, but the general - 1 penalty does not, apply. An archer gets the full benefit of any attack bonuses from other sources, such as magic.`,

I suggest that a druid either sees what everybody else sees but knows it's a fake (something like walking through a museum forest exhibit with artificial trees in it) or sees the actual terrain with a ghost image of a forest superimposed over it.

A spell such as ***stoneskin***, which protects the recipient from physical attacks, is never subject to magic resistance. ***Protection from evil*** is sometimes subject to magic resistance. Only when the spell's third effect (which forms a barrier against planar and conjured creatures and forces such creatures to recoil) comes into play does magic resistance have any affect on the spell. The spell's other two effects, which make the spell's recipient harder to hurt, are not subject to magic resistance (though if a magic resistence roll suceeds against the the third effect the whole spell collapses). For example, a leprechaun has a formidable magic resistance, but because a leprechaun is not hedged out by the spell (because it is not a conjured or planar creature), its magic resistance does not affect ***protection from evil*** spells.`,

Does a wizard who has detected spells being stolen automatically know who the jackal is? How often can a jackal steal spells?`,
            answer: [
                `Judging from the kit description, I suggest that a wizard who detects a jackal's spell theft can look at the jackal and know that character has stolen spells. This ability should last as long as the jackal is actually stealing spells and for one round thereafter per level of the victim. For example, an 11th-level victim could recognize a jackal who stole his spells for as long as the spell stealing went on and for 11 rounds thereafter. The wizard can study one other character each round when attempting to detect a jackal who has stolen his spells. Spell stealing requires concentration, which probably makes a jackal stand out in a crowd. Also, a jackal might notice when a victim begins searching.

Is it really as easy to block the club of a halfling as it is to block a giant's club? Could a pixie character disarm an ogre? Given the emphasis ***C&T*** has placed upon size, this rather surprised me. Shouldn't the opposed roll of the attacker be penalized/increased by +4 or so per size difference? Say a human fighter is attempting to block an attack from another human fighter, the former must make an attack roll against AC 4. Say this same fighter attempts to block the attack of an ogre, shouldn't this be penalized, say to roll against AC 0? Against a giant, perhaps against AC -4? Why were such penalties applied toward overbearing and tripping but not the rest?`,

Rikard's Strength score is 16 and Jon's is 17. If Rikard hits, there is an opposed Strength roll to see if a knockdown occurs. Rikard rolls an 8, a success; Jon rolls a 10, also a success. Normally Jon would win the roll because he succeeded with a roll higher than his opponents. Rikard's large shield, however, gives him a +3 to his check, so his roll is effectively an 11, which is high enough to win.

            answer: [
                `Both of these statements are false. First, everyone rolls initiative normally, and the side with the lowest roll wins. It is possible, however, to win initiative and still not strike first. For example, a hill giant armed with a club has a base initiative of slow and has a weapon speed of fast. Any creature's attack, however, comes during its base phase or its weapon's phase, whichever is *worse*. So, will a giant always strike after a human, whose base initiative is fast? Not necessarily. A human armed with a fast weapon, such as a dagger, usually will strike before a giant. The human also would go first if armed with an average weapon, such as a long sword. If the human has a slow weapon, however, such as a two-handed sword, he is as slow as the giant, and the initiative roll determines who goes first when two opponents act in the same phase. Even if the human has a fast or average weapon, the giant still won't always strike second. Its superior reach allows it to guard or charge and automatically strike first, no matter what its initiative roll is. If the human gets in nice and close so the giant can't guard or charge, the giant can always overrun the human (and maybe half the human's party in the process) and move off someplace where it can guard or charge the next round.`,
                `A human armed with a dagger usually will strike before a human armed with a long sword (a fast character with a fast weapon strikes before a fast character with an average weapon) unless the character armed with a long sword is charging or guarding. Before you decide that daggers are the weapon of choice, take another look at the weapons' damage ratings and knockdown numbers and at the critical hit rules. The swordsman is going to win over the long run. Note that if you interpret the rules strictly, a character armed with a dagger always strikes first when charging or guarding against a character of the same size armed with a long sword, because both weapons have the same melee reach. Use some common sense and let the swordsman go first.`,
                `In discussing this last point with ***C&T*** co-author Rich Baker, we came up the following general rule, which we both agreed should have been in the book in the first place: In a situation where a character is charging or guarding against an opponent with a weapon that has the same reach, the figure with the large weapon (or the larger creature) goes first. For example, a human swordsman guarding against a human attacker armed with a dagger goes first. A troll guarding against a human attacker with a dagger also goes first because it is a large creature guarding against a small weapon.`

Smaller creatures generally are quicker to react than bigger ones are, even when what they're doing is purely mental. Besides, if a baku really gets annoyed with a brain mole that keeps beating him to the punch, the baku can always overrun the brain mole and stomp it into the dirt. Note that many psionic abilities don't happen until a round's resolution phase. If a power has a preparation time of a round or more, it's among the last things to take effect. If you don't want to stick psionicists with acting on their base initiative phase all the time, you can make psionic powers with preparation times of fast or very fast. Or, you can roll 1d10 to determine the power's base phase. This reflects the ever changing state of the psionicist's mind and helps keep the players guessing about what's going to happen from phase to phase.`,

            answer: [
                `Here's something to tide you over until something better comes along: Assume that the creature's Wisdom score is about equal to its Intelligence score. To determine the creature's scores, look up the monster's entry in the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL*** tome or the ***MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM®*** tome and note its general intelligence rating. A parenthetical note right next to the rating tells give you a range of mental ability scores. For example, a ki-rin has an intelligence rating of supra-genius, giving in a rating of 19-20 in both Wisdom and Intelligence. You can roll 1d6 to determine the exact score (1-3= 19, 4-6=20). Once you have the scores, calculate its MAC using table 74 (***S&P***, page 144) just like you would for a character. If a particular ki-rin has a Wisdom of 19 and an Intelligence of 20, its MAC would be 3. If you want a wider range of scores for the creature, you'll find tables for generating creature's ability scores in Chapter 2 of the ***DUNGEON MASTER™ Option: High-Level Campaigns*** book, pages 58-61. Creatures with racial psionic abilities, such as su-monsters and mind flayers, should get an additional bonus of +1 to +3.`,

            question: `How do you decide if a grenade-like missile strikes its target? I've looked in both the ***PHB*** and the ***DMG*** and I could find nothing that says what attack number a grenade-like missile uses.`,
            answer: [
                `A grenade-like missile's actual attack number varies according to the circumstances. If a creature is not the target and the character is within short range (10' for a flask of oil or other lightweight object) of the target point, a hit should be automatic. For example, if a character wants to smash a flask of oil at the top of a staircase the party has just ascended, the flask should land where the character wants it to as long as the target point is within 10' of the character. If the character is rushed, or the target point is farther way than 10', treat the target point as Armor Class 10 and apply the appropriate range modifier. (In the core rules, a thrown oil flask has a medium range of 20' and a long range of 30'.)`,
                `If the grenade-like missile target is a creature, the attack number depends on what the missile is. If the missile is something like a boulder or a container holding a fairly small amount of liquid that has to make direct contact with the target creature to have any effect (such as a vial of acid or holy water), then just use the creature's armor class and resolve the grenade toss as you would any other missile attack (except that you would roll for scatter if the attack misses).`,
                `If the grenade-like missile holds a fairly hefty amount of material, such as a flask of oil, I suggest rolling an attack vs. armor class 7, adjusted for the target's Dexterity score and movement rate; I suggest +3 for stationary targets, -3 for targets moving a rate faster than 3 but slower than 12, and -6 for targets moving at a rate of 12 or greater.

Such effects include: ***charm monster***, ***charm person***, ***charm person or mammal***, ***domination***, ***eyebite*** (charm effect only, the sleep effect works normally on elves and half-elves, as do the fear and sicken effects), ***fire charm***, ***mass charm***, and ***sleep***.

                `First, there's nothing in the spell that says the caster gets to pick the transformed creature's age. That's for the DM to decide. You might want to apply the subject creature's age to the lifespan of the assumed form to determine the assumed form's maturity. In the case of a rat, the resulting dragon is always going to be a hatchling because rats just don't live that long. Or perhaps the subject's level of maturity translates directly into the assumed form's maturity. So if a caster wants a great wyrm dragon he has to find a really old and decrepit rat.`,

If the caster picks a young and healthy rat (with a reasonable chance to survive a system shock roll), he should get a hatchling gold dragon. Being young, the dragon is hungry. Being violently thrust into dragonhood, the dragon is shy and insecure. The dragon might follow the character around, eating the character's treasure (gold dragons eat gems), occasionally cutting loose with its breath weapon because it is scared (maybe it saw a cat), and making a general nuisance of itself. Imagine the scene if the dragon visits a jewelry shop for a snack. Being lawful good, the dragon surely will tell the irate jeweler and the town guard where "mom" is.`,
                `If the caster chooses a venerable old rat, the creature's system shock percentage should be very low (35% or less); let's face it, old rats aren't going to have really high Constitution scores. If the caster does manage to create a venerable, wyrm, or great wyrm gold dragon, the creature probably is going to take charge. Gold dragons are lawful good, but no creature with 22 or more hit dice is going to take orders from a measly 7th-level wizard. The dragon might help the character in some small way, but the character probably will find himself embarked on some series of adventures of the dragon's choosing before long. Woe to the character when an errant ***dispel magic*** spell ends the enchantment and the poor fool is left stranded somewhere with only a mangy rat for company.`,
                `Many spells in the game are prone to abuse, but only if the DM lets players get away with it. Greedy NPCs, of course, usually get their comeuppance out offstage. It might be amusing to stage an encounter with an enchanted gold dragon and its unwilling wizard servant as a cautionary tale to the players.`

The section on Intelligence in the ***Player's Handbook*** says the character notices some inconsistency in the illusion that automatically allows the character to make his saving throw.

            answer: [
                `If you follow the rules to the letter, creatures with Intelligence scores of 19 or higher automatically make successful saving throws against low-level illusions, as shown on Table 4 in the ***PHB***. If the illusion in question does not allow a saving throw, then the character is still affected. For example, a character with an Intelligence score of 20 is automatically unaffected by any illusion/phantasm spells of 1st or 2nd level, provided they allow saving throws. The character could ignore an ***improved phantasmal force*** spell, which allows a saving throw, but is affected normally by a ***mirror image*** spell, which does not allow a saving throw. When in doubt, check the spell description. If the saving throw entry at the beginning of the spell says "None" the spell has no saving throw. Note that for classic illusions such as ***phantasmal force***, ***improved phantasmal force***, ***spectral force***, and the like, a saving throw and disbelief are one in the same. That's why these spells have saving throws listed as "Special." Normally, characters have to do something (state disbelief) before they roll saving throws against these spells. Creatures with very high Intelligence scores get to disbelieve land save) automatically.`,

I'm also pretty good at it, and the local players quickly dropped their reservations about having a newbie in the group and invited me into the campaign. I have several characters who have become important in the campaign, and I've kept a detailed journal of all my character's adventures. Not long ago, my boyfriend and I had a private (not game related) disagreement, and the gaming group decided to take his side. Now, I'm barred from the campaign, and the DM says I can't play my characters anywhere else. (One of my characters started out as an NPC that the DM gave me to play.) Someone in the group even walked into my house while I was away and took my characters and my dice. It was probably the DM; he often uses the game to get his own way. If a player doesn't do what he wants, the player's character gets killed in the next game. I'm really mad because the DM won't give my characters back. My boyfriend and I aren't playing anymore, but I still want my characters back. Can a DM tell a player not to use a character anymore? As a capable female player I used to be pretty hot commodity, but now I'm barred from the game. What should I do? The only thing I can think of now is to sock the DM in the gut until he gives me my stuff (and believe me, I have some friends who would be delighted to do just that). I just want to play AD&D.`,
            answer: [
                `The first thing you should do is step back and take a few deep breaths. If you're involved in a campaign where people carry grudges from real life into the game, and also take them back to real life again, it's high time you found a new campaign. If you can walk away from it after losing only a few characters and a bag of dice, you should feel lucky. Take a little time away from the game; judging from the full text of your letter (six pages), I'd say your gaming has put you under entirely too much emotional stress. Gaming is supposed to be *fun*.`,
                `To answer your rules question, no, there's nothing in the books that says DMs can tell their players what characters to use in other campaigns. If you've got a character you like—even a dead character—from an old campaign and you think it would be fun to play it somewhere else, go right ahead. You should explain to the new DM, however, that you've played the character before. Some DMs don't like to accept recycled characters.`,
                `As far as your future involvement in the campaign and any further attempts to get your property (dice and characters) back, here are my suggestions:`,
                `First, find another campaign to play in. There are literally millions of AD&D players out there, so your entire AD&D game experience does not depend on this one group. Better yet, start a campaign of your own. Stop being flattered that a group of veterans took you in and start showing a group of newbies how to play the game right—you've certainly got plenty of experience with a game that is played wrong. Your journal should give you plenty of ideas for a campaign of your own.`,
                `Second, give up on the NPC you adopted. It's churlish of the DM who gave you the character to ask you not to play it anymore, but the character is not worth the struggle, no matter how much you love it. If you're as good at the game as you say you are, you'll have no trouble creating another great character on your own. Besides, if the DM is on a power trip you'll deny him the satisfaction he gets from withholding the character from you. If you're really fond of the character, create a new character based on the one you lost. Perhaps the new character is the original character's twin, who has gone out adventuring to find out why the original character mysteriously disappeared.`,
                `Third, either take legal action to get your stolen property back or let it go. Do not under any circumstance "sock" the DM in the gut or send your friends to snatch your property back. If your former gaming comrades took your property without your permission they're guilty of theft, pure and simple. That is a matter for the police, not for you or for your friends. On the other hand, you can always create new characters and buy new dice. Doing so probably will take less time, effort and anguish than wresting with the legal system, especially since your case probably isn't going to enjoy a very high priority with the local police and district attorney. It's up to you.`

            answer: [
                `Here's the point: A spell's effective "casting level" can vary. Magical items that produce spell-like effects are the most common examples. Wands, for instance, can be enchanted to duplicate spells of any level, but any spell-like effects they produce function at 6th-level for purposes of range, damage, duration, and any other spell variable that depends on the caster's level. A ***wand of chain lightning*** could only produce a bolt of lighting with a maximum damage rating of 6d6 and a maximum range of 70 yards. It makes no difference that ***chain lighting*** requires a 12th-level caster; the best the wand can do is 6d6 points of damage. Any number of other conditions also can change a spell's casting level; planar effects and wild magic head the list.`,

            question: `The player characters in my campaign once found a big gold statue that was much too heavy for them to carry away. Rather than hacking the thing to bits and hauling away the pieces, the party cleric cast a ***frisky chest*** spell on the statue. The rest of the party lined up at strategic positions along the route back to the entrance and herded the statue all the way outside, where they had a chariot waiting. Is this feat really possible, I did I give my players an undeserved gift?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***frisky chest*** spell can affect any object small enough to fit inside a 10' cube. If the statue wasn't too big, you and your players did things according to the rules.`,
                `Now, ***frisky chest*** is a spell designed to help priests protect their stuff, it's not for extracting treasure from dungeons. So, your players were abusing the spell and you might indeed have given them and undeserved gift. Because ***frisky chest*** is suppose to foil thieves, the statue's movements should have been contrary to what the players wanted at every possible opportunity. Now consider how much noise a walking statue might make. Were there any denizens of the dungeon within earshot? A surprise attack by a group of monsters might have really wrecked the party's day, especially if they were separated and concentrating on the statue when the attack came. Also think about how much the statue weighed. Could the chariot hold all that weight when the party finally herded the statue aboard? Could the dungeon floor hold the statue as the it ambled along? Note that the spell allows the animated object to sprout whatever appendages are most appropriate. Did the statue sprout wings and fly away when the PCs finally got it outside? Note also that any restraint place on the object breaks a ***frisky chest*** spell. So, the party might have caught the statue as it flew away, but the minute they got hold of it they would have been holding dead weight. That might be inconvenient if anyone was standing under it at the time.`,
                `Keep all of the foregoing in mind if your players try the same trick again. You also might want to put a weight limit on the ***frisky chest*** spell to discourage really egregious abuse. I suggest 100 pounds per caster level.`

The penalty would be even less if you had the blindfighting skill.`,

                `The spell description says ***mirror image*** creates exact duplicates of the caster. Considering the spell's short duration and purely defensive nature, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the images include sound and smell as well as sight. On the other hand, ***mirror image*** is only a 2nd-level spell, and "Sage Advice" has previously suggested that invisibility foils displacement. I suggest you go ahead and allow characters to ignore ***mirror images*** if they can't see them. Remember, however, that fighting blind is just like fighting in total darkness, which carries more than just an attack penalty (see Table 72 in the ***DMG***).

            question: `How much should characters know about magical items when they find them? ***Detect magic*** spells can reveal that an item is enchanted, but what about specific powers?`,
            answer: [
                `Generally, characters should know very little about the magical items they find. Divination spells such as ***identify***, ***commune***, ***contact other plane***, and ***legend lore*** can reveal or at least hint at specific powers. Otherwise, characters just have to experiment with newly acquired items and try to puzzle them out. Even a small sip of a potion for example, produces a minor effect that hints at the potion's enchantment. A sip of a growth potion, for instance, might make a character's clothing or armor feel tight. Items that produce continual effects are fairly easy to test. A character who has just donned a ***ring of water walking***, for example, will have a pretty good idea what he has after a trip to the local pond or fountain.`,
                `Items with specific triggers or command words are trickier. Usually, the owner will have to visit the local sage, bard, or high-level spellcaster to get some clue about how to start experimenting with the item. Some DMs devise intricate puzzles their players must solve before their characters can use their items. It all depends on how rare and wonderful the DM wants to make magic. If players have to work hard for their magic they tend to appreciate it more.`,
                `Note that intelligent items such as swords might be able to tell their owners what their powers are (though they don't always do so). Also, nothing beats instructions from the previous owner when trying to figure out a magical item's properties. Taking a few prisoners and negotiating with them carefully can be well worth the effort.`

            answer: [
                `You're confusing the aura of protection that surrounds a paladin with a ***protection from evil*** spell. In the AD&D 2nd Edition game, the two are similar, but not the same. A paladin's aura of protection doesn't hedge out anything. Evil, conjured, or enchanted creatures within 10' of the paladin suffer a -1 attack penalty, but the aura doesn't keep them out. The aura, like a ***protection from evil*** spell, also prevents any form magical control from being exerted across the barrier.`,
                `Note that it is not possible to exert force across the barrier formed by ***protection from evil*** or a ***protection from evil 10' radius*** spell. Neither version of the spell creates a giant hamster ball like an ***Ottiluke's resilient sphere*** does. If a creature that normally would be hedged out by the spell, nothing happens if it pushes against the barrier. The creature cannot cross the barrier, but it also cannot make the character at the center of the spell move, not even by a micron.

            answer: [
                `A knockdown die of 1d12 increases to 1d20. I don't recommend allowing any knockdown die to increase beyond 1d20. (As it is, rolling 1d20 will give a knockdown chance about half the time against huge opponents and even more often against smaller opponents.) I also don't recommend increasing any knockdown die more than three places. For example, a creature armed with a dagger never gets a knockdown die bigger than 1d10, no matter how big or skilled it is.`,

For example, you can roll 1d30 by rolling a 10-sided die and a six-sided die. If the six-sided die comes up a 1 or 2, read the 10-sided die as it is. If the six-sided die rolls a 3 or 4, add 10 to the number on the 10-sided die, and if the six-sided die comes up a 5 or 6 add 20 to the number on the 10-sided die.`

For most campaigns, you can just announce that reality has changed and that things will be different from now on. To add a little mystery, you might want to explain that no one, not even the PCs, remembers any other kind of defiling.

For example, perhaps defilers only have to make Intelligence checks when memorizing spells after sunrise, and the defiling effect of memorization might be minimal, a radius of inches. Over the next few weeks or months, gradually increase both the radius of the defiling effect and decrease the number of hours in a day that the effect can be avoided.

Or do the missiles from the spell, which strike their targets unerringly, zip around the thief and strike the fighter, thus revealing the thief's presence?`,
            answer: [
                `The *missile* or *missiles* from the ***magic missile*** spell in your example would strike the fighter, because the fighter is the spell's target. Whether the invisible thief is revealed is entirely up to the DM. The missiles might streak directly toward the fighter and turn abruptly to avoid the thief, or they might curve so gradually that nobody notices. Even in the first instance, the *missiles* might move so fast that an observer wouldn't notice them changing course.`,

This situation is similar to what would happen if the thief jostled a piece of furniture or a curtain. If the DM decides the *missiles'* erratic course could betray the thief's presence, any observers should attempt saving throws vs. spells. Observers making successful saving throws would detect the thief and know his approximate location, while observers failing their saving throws would notice nothing.`

                `The FORGOTTEN REALMS® Campaign Setting contains just such a rule about half-elven heredity.

The ***Player's Handbook***, however, says that anyone with both human and elven ancestors is either a human or a half-elf (see ***PHB***, page 30).

            answer: [
                `Charging is a full-move action, but it's included on the half-move list for two reasons. First, it is possible that a charging character might enter melee range with the enemy during the first half of his movement. In such a case, the character stops moving and makes his attack; once he stops to attack, his movement is over (though he still can make the standard one-square adjustment after the attack). Second, its okay to let a character who already has made a half move to charge during the second half of his movement. Players often wish their characters to make delayed charges in response to unexpected moves from the enemy, when their comrades suffer knockdowns, and in many other situations. A character making a "half charge" is subject to all the bonuses and penalties associated with charging (see ***Combat & Tactics***, page 25).`,

                `No, there isn't, but here are a few basic rules of thumb for you: A one-slot proficiency should cost three character points.

            answer: [
                `The first step in determining any character's age is to generate a starting age from Table 11 in the ***PHB***. Now, divide that value by the absolute maximum age for the character's race (also determined from Table 11). Multiply the quotient by the character's actual maximum age (again from Table 11). This is the character's "geezer factor." If person playing the character is past middle age himself, double the geezer factor (everyone knows time passes faster for older people). If the person playing the character is a game advice columnist who has begun to ponder just how many people there are out there who just have to have a rule for everything, triple the geezer factor (because thoughts of this kind will make you old in a real hurry). In any case, for every 50,000 experience points the character earns he ages one geezer factor.`,

                `Have you done that? I hope not, because the Sage was just pulling your leg.`,
                `How about this as an alternate method: Determine the character's starting age (Table 11 again), and then figure out how much time has gone by in the campaign since the character started play. (Pretty clever, huh? That's why I get the big bucks.) If you need help with campaign time, check out Chapter 14 in the ***Player's Handbook*** and Chapter 14 in the ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide***. Of course, if you asked your question because you're creating a new character at level 20 or higher, just make him whatever age you want him to be. If you think 25 to 30 years old is too young, you're probably right. To set the character's age, start by thinking about how much game time it might take to gain 20 or more levels (if you haven't any idea, you probably shouldn't be creating characters of that level). Now consider any notable events from the character's past (you weren't really going to create a brand-new character of level 20+ without giving him a history were you?). For example, if a 20th-level warrior's claim to fame was that he lead the imperial army to victory 50 years ago, he's almost certainly going to be considerably more than 50 years old; after all, babes in diapers usually don't command imperial armies, but then again anything's possible in a fantasy game and there's always the chance the character has been subjected to some kind of magical age adjustment.`,
                `In short, there is no hard-and-fast rule governing how fast characters age once they start play, its all a matter of judgment (and perhaps a little bookkeeping) on the part of the Player and the DM.`

            question: `If a wizard uses a ***shape change*** spell to turn into a dragon, can he pick what age category of dragon he turns into? If not, what age is the dragon? This is important, because a dragon's age category determines what spell-like abilities it has and how much damage its breath weapon inflicts.`,
            answer: [
                `Because ***shape change*** is a 9th-level spell that costs 5,000 gp to cast, I'm inclined to be generous. Let the caster state the approximate size of dragon he's changing into, then check that size against the age table in the ***MONSTROUS MANUAL™*** tome for the type of dragon the character has chosen. It's helpful to have the caster state the dragon's body length; you can calculate the creature's tail length separately if the need arises. For example, a wizard who changes into a red dragon with a body 100' long, he'd become a mature adult (because mature adult red dragons have body lengths ranging from 99' to 118'). The dragon's tail length would be about 90' (near the lower end of the range). The wizard would gain the dragon's Armor Class of –6 and the dragon's movement abilities: flight at speed of 30 (C) walking at speed of 9 and the ability to make jumps up to 30 yards. The wizard also gains a mature adult red dragon's physical attacks, immunity to fire, and infravision.`,
                `The wizard does not get the dragon's breath weapon, spell-like abilities (including the ability to detect invisible creatures), or fear aura because these powers depend on a dragon's innate magical nature and superior intellect (if the DM is feeling particularly ungenerous, he can disallow the fire immunity as well). The wizard does not gain the dragon's magic resistance either, because a ***shape change*** spell never bestows magic resistance.`,
                `Note that a character using the much weaker ***polymorph self*** spell can't change into a form any larger than a hippopotamus, which would limit the character to the form of a hatchling red dragon, and the caster would get no extra abilities beyond normal flight.`

                `There seem to be some sloppy gaps in the current ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide***. When TSR gets around to doing a third edition, I hope it contains more standardized rules for dealing with daily occurrences. For example, I give you the following scenario, which I encountered the last time I ran a game:`,
                `A party of adventurers kills a dragon in a hall dominated by an ancient dwarven throne carved entirely out of one giant emerald. Behind the throne is a magical elven airboat lying on its side. While the party druid goes to investigate the ship, the berserker gets good and drunk. While the druid searches the ship's hold the berserker finds a large keg of gunpowder and places it under the throne. Then he lays a trail of oil from the keg to the hall entrance. The berserker gets no response when he shouts to the druid, so he drops his torch and plugs his ears. Meanwhile, the druid emerges from the hold to see what the berserker wanted. Boom! Now, assuming that the throne fails its saving throw and the boat lies between the druid and the throne, what is the chance that the druid blows up, too? What are the chances that the entire party is killed by emerald shrapnel? If the druid survives the blast and the shrapnel, what are the chances the boat lands on her? How much damage does a medium sized eleven airboat do? Does the berserker get an extra experience points for inventing rocketry?`
            ],
            answer: [
                `Yeah boy, you've found a big hole in the rules all right. People go around blowing up furniture-sized emeralds with kegs of gunpowder all the time; this situation must have happened in campaigns here in the Lake Geneva area three or four times last week alone. Even as you read this, teams of designers are feverishly at work perfecting shrapnel rules for all types of gemstones, not just emeralds.`,
                `Are you wondering just when these great new rules will be available to the general public? If you are, stop, because no such rules are being written.`,
                `I'll start my real answer to this question by noting that slaying dragons and recovering throne-sized emeralds are not everyday events in well-run campaigns. Such things happen in great campaigns, but only as major events that cap a series of epic adventures. When PCs can bump off the game's biggest, baddest monsters and haul home tons of loot after every session the campaign is well on its way to being a memory (and probably not a fond one).`,
                `Likewise, it's incumbent on the DM to put a little thought into encounters. If you place a keg of gunpowder in a treasure hoard, you darn well should decide what's likely to happen if the PCs blow it up long before the game starts. You can't predict everything players will have their characters do, but continual improvisation kills a campaign.`,
                `So, before you decided your encounter was ready to play you should have decided how much damage potential that keg of power had. For brevity's sake, let's say your keg held 100 charges of powder (a pouch holds a maxim of 18, see ***DMG***, page 238). That gives the whole keg of damage potential of 200 points and a blast radius of 15' (also from page 238 of the ***DMG***). Knowing that, your next step is reconsidering whether to let that much destructive power into your game. You also should consider what the dragon would do with the powder; dragons aren't stupid, you know (it wasn't a red dragon, was it?). Now consider the conditions in the dungeon. Is the place fairly dry? (Wet gunpowder just doesn't blow up.)`,
                `Lets assume the power was dry and your players really are silly enough to let the berserker waste it and put another party member in jeopardy at the same time. Now 200 points is a lot of damage, but gunpowder provides more push than smash, so the throne might break if it fails an item saving throw, but it's just not going to shatter. At worst, it's just going to hop a bit into the air and crack in half when it lands. Characters outside the 15' blast radius suffer no damage, which probably includes the druid if the boat's deck points away from the throne. Nor is the blast going be powerful enough to lift a boat large enough to have a hold so big that a character has to climb inside and search for awhile to find out what's inside. In any case the boat's bulk is going to absorb the blast and shield the druid.`,
                `And, no, the berserker shouldn't get any extra experience from this little bit of silliness.`

            question: `I run a FORGOTTEN REALMS® campaign. Recently, the PCs discovered and explored an ancient illusionist's crypt. Within, they found more that 80 stone tablets that comprised the dead illusionists spell books. The tablets were too heavy to move, so the party came back later and did rubbings of the tablets. All the spells were written in the secret language of illusionists. From what I can gather from the FORGOTTEN REALMS boxed set, this language possesses some dweomer. My impression is that it is resistant to ***comprehend languages*** and similar spells, and thus unreadable to all but actual specialty wizard illusionists. I would think that a secret language of wizards would not be susceptible to something as simple as this or other low-level spells. Is this correct?`,
            answer: [
                `The 1st-level wizard spell ***comprehend languages*** cannot decipher magical writing or magically warded writing (see spell description, ***Player's Handbook***, Appendix 3, page 172). Insofar as Ruthlek (the secret script used by illusionists in the FORGOTTEN REALMS world) is "dweomer guarded," a character using ***comprehend languages*** should not be able to read it. A ***read magic*** spell, however, does allow characters to read Ruthlek.`,
                `On the other hand, copying spell books is a difficult process that takes time (one to two days of work per level of the spell being copied) and materials of the highest quality. Simple tracings or rubbings cannot duplicate a spell book.`

            answer: [
                `No. To cast a true dweomer, a character has to complete preparations for the spell and roll the final difficulty number or higher on 1d100. Obviously, if the spell's final difficulty is more than 100, the spell can't be cast (because you can't roll more than 100 on 1d100). Currently, there is no skill or item in the game that grants characters bonuses to difficulty rolls, but the spell caster can modify the spell by adding special conditions and material components that reduce the difficulty number.`,
                `Using material components and special conditions to reduce a spell's difficulty has some limits, as explained on pages 130 through 133. If the caster can't provide enough conditions and components to lower the final difficulty to 100 or less, he can double the spell's preparation time and reduce the spell's final difficulty by half. If that still doesn't do the trick, the caster has to go back to the drawing board and redesign the spell or go looking for enough exotic spell components to get the difficulty down to a workable number; there's no limit to the number of exotic material components used in a true dweomer.`,
                `Casting true dweomers requires patience, dedication, and imagination from both the player and the DM. A powerful true dweomer could take years of game time to complete as the caster scours the land for components. If either the DM or player doesn't feel up to it, it's best not to use true dweomers at all.`

            answer: [
                `Whether any monster can use a breath weapon with its mouth shut is entirely up to the DM. Common sense suggests that a dragon (or any other creature with a breath attack) would have to open its jaws at least a little to loose a breath weapon. But, it is also reasonable to assume that a creature can use its breath weapon if it can breathe. It doesn't matter which option you choose, so long as you use it consistently.`,
                `Note that just tying a creature's mouth shut probably won't guarantee that it can't use its breath weapon, it might break the bonds or work them loose and blast away when its captor least expects it.`,

If an attack, such as a ***fireball*** spell, affects multiple creatures at once, the bonus or penalty is applied once to the damage roll. If an attack is split up so that it affects several creatures individually, such as a ***magic missile*** spell, the bonus or penalty is applied to the damage each creature receives.

The spell description says symbols, glyphs, and abjuration spells already operating in the engine's area when it activates are not neutralized. This implies that other spells in the area are. For instance, a ***wall of force*** (an evocation spell), would be negated if a ***spell engine*** activates in its area. Is that correct?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, that's correct. Note that a spell is "already operating" if it is cast outside the ***spell engine's*** area of effect and then brought into the area. For example, an ***anti-magic shell*** created outside the ***spell engine's*** area and then moved so that its radius overlaps the ***spell engine's*** area is not neutralized. Instead it temporarily negates the ***spell engine's*** effects within the area of overlap. If the ***anti-magic shell's*** area of effect overlaps the ***spell engine's*** area at the time of casting, however, the ***anti-magic shell*** is negated; the ***spell engine*** prevents the ***shell*** from forming.

If the latter is true, one might cast ***contingency*** and designate an ***armor*** spell as the contingent effect with the trigger being "whenever the armor spell currently protecting me runs out." The ***contingency*** caster would get continuous armor protection for many days, right? What kind of triggers can the ***contingency*** caster specify? Can he bring a *contingent* spell into being just by snapping his fingers? Also, does the caster's situation have any effect on a *contingent* spell? For example, if the caster is bound and gagged when the trigger occurs, does the contingent effect still occur?`,
            answer: [
                `The ***contingency*** spell must be cast simultaneously with one other spell. The companion spell is essentially precast and takes effect only when the ***contingency*** triggers it. Once the companion spell is triggered, the whole spell complex ends. The caster cannot load multiple spells into the ***contingency*** nor can he add new spells once the original spell has been triggered. If the caster wants to duplicate a particular effect, he must cast the ***contingency*** and the companion spell all over again (but note that a character can have only one ***contingency*** operating at a time). The ***contingency*** spell's duration really should read "one day per caster level or until triggered."`,
                `The condition that triggers the ***contingency*** can be just about anything the caster can imagine, but it has to be fairly simple. Generally, it must be a single event or condition, not a series of things. When the DM decides a ***contingency*** might fail, he is free to decide how likely the failure will be. It could be automatic, or there could be a saving throw, ability check, or other die roll involved—whatever the DM thinks is reasonable.`,

Defensive disarms are resolved when the disarming character's opponent attacks. Offensive disarms have two potential advantages. First, if the character attempting to disarm is entitled to multiple attacks during a round, he can automatically cover a disarmed opponent with the remaining attacks, which should allow him the first strike if his disarmed opponent doesn't surrender. Second, if the character gains the first action during the round and succeeds with an offensive disarm, the opponent will be weaponless when his turn comes to attack. Even if the character who made the disarm doesn't have another attack he can use to cover the disarmed opponent, he might get an attack of opportunity when the opponent tries to retrieve his dropped weapon.`,

            question: `Please give me a clarification on the 5th-level wizard spell ***contact other plane***. The optional rule box about aligned planes mentions a correlation between the caster's level and the maximum intelligence that he may contact, though the main spell description mentions nothing about caster level other than the number of questions that may be asked. Are there actually such limits on the contactable intelligence or may the wizard choose to contact whichever intelligence he wishes from the outset?`,
            answer: [
                `No matter which rule you use, the mind contacted is determined randomly, usually by roiling 1d10. If you use the optional rule, the spell caster picks the plane he contacts. If the caster chooses an outer plane, roll 1d8 instead of 1d10. A roll of 1 indicates that caster has contacted the equivalent of an Astral intelligence. A roll of 8 indicates the caster has contacted a being with an Intelligence score of 25. However, any difference in alignment between the caster and the prevailing alignment on the plane contacted (see the PLANESCAPE™ boxed set) reduces the intelligence the caster actually contacts by reducing the die roll (which is always at least "1"). The reduction works as explained in the optional rule box. The reference to the caster's level in the optional rule box is superfluous because caster level has no bearing on the intelligence contacted.`,

            question: `When developing new characters for the AD&D game, do the initial scores rolled for Ability Scores include the racial bonuses? Or is the bonus given after a roll meets the minimum? For example, a minotaur needs a Constitution of 12 as a minimum requirement. Minotaurs also receive a +2 bonus to their Constitution. If the player rolls a 10, can he add the bonus to meet the minimum requirement? Or must the player roll a score of 12 on the dice first, then apply the bonus?`,
            answer: [
                `In most cases, a new character has to meet the ability score requirements for his race before making any racial adjustments to Ability Scores. For example, if a player rolls a 10 for a character's Constitution score and an 18 for the same character's Charisma score, that character cannot be a dwarf because Table 7 in the ***PHB*** lists a minimum Constitution of 11 for dwarves and limits dwarves to 17 in Charisma. The character can't be a dwarf even though dwarves get a +1 Constitution bonus and a -1 Charisma penalty because the player must consult the table *before* making any adjustments. The same character could become a gnome, however, and would apply the ability adjustments for gnomes from Table 8. Note that at the beginning of play, a dwarf's maximum Constitution score is 19 (18+1) and a dwarf's maximum Charisma score is 16 (17-1).`,
                `Unfortunately, not all the expansions to the AD&D game follow the ***PHB's*** example. For instance, the ***Complete Book of Humanoids*** lists adjusted scores in its racial ability score tables. (This explains why Table 12 includes so many numbers lower than three and higher than 18.) In this case, the player must make the racial adjustments to the character's ability scores and consult the table. If the character doesn't meet the requirements after the adjustments, the character's Ability Scores revert to their unadjusted values and the player has to choose a different race for the character.`

            question: `My question pertains to the psionicist power ectoplasmic form. One of the players in our group is rather fond of turning into ectoplasmic form, picking up objects, sticking them into people, and letting go. He claims this is an instant kill. Is this valid? Is it an evil act? Are there any special saving throws applicable? Also, what are the effects of sticking objects into objects?`,
            answer: [
                `No, what you describe isn't a valid use of the ectoplasmic form power. No, it's not necessarily evil. No, there are no special saves.`,
                `A character assuming ectoplasmic form can take along clothing, armor, and up to 15 Ibs. of equipment he's carrying. Weapons, backpacks, magical items, and the like don't automatically come along; they count toward the 15-lb. limit. The character has to leave any excess equipment behind. Anything the character isn't holding or carrying when he assumes ectoplasmic form doesn't go along. So the character cannot assume ectoplasmic form, walk across a room, pick up a rock, and make that ectoplasmic too.`,
                `Anything the character converts into ectoplasmic form stays in that form until the character resumes his own normal form, even if the character drops the object. Resuming normal form inside a solid object or inside another creature can be harmful, but only to the ectoplasmic creature. The solid object or creature has dibs on the space it occupies. At best, the ectoplasmic creature or object is displaced a sufficient distance so it can materialize without harm. I suggest, however, that the ectoplasmic character is violently forced through a dimensional rift to the Ethereal plane, suffering 3d10 hp damage — with no chance for a saving throw. Sticking an ectoplasmic object into something else and materializing is just as nasty as sticking part of the character's body into something; the person responsible for making the rift is drawn inside of it and suffers damage.`

            question: `Would you please clarify the use of the ***feign death*** spell, particularly with regard to its casting time of ½? Does this mean that the caster uses it just prior to an opponents' attack? Is it so quick that the attacker does not realize that the spell was cast? If the spell is cast prior to an attack does the attack now hit automatically? Won't the attacker become suspicious if the caster "drops dead" after a missed attack?`,
            answer: [
                `Technically, a spell's casting time is added to the caster's initiative roll to determine exactly when the spell takes effect. Since the initiative system uses only whole numbers, the casting time of ½ is problematical. In this case, I think the intent is to allow the caster to cast the spell pretty much instantaneously. I recommend treating ***feign death*** like an innate ability, but with no initiative modifier. An opponent can beat the caster to the punch, but he can't disrupt the spell. The caster can time the spell so that it takes effect right after an opponents attack if he wishes.`,
                `The spell has a verbal component, so an alert opponent might notice the casting. An opponent successfully using the spellcraft proficiency while watching the spellcaster would know the caster used a necromantic spell. Other witnesses might be allowed a slim chance — no better than a check vs. one half Intelligence — and then only if they had some reason to suspect a spell. (***Feign death*** has no somatic or material component, so its not easy to catch.) In any case, combat in the AD&D game always works in the abstract; "misses" might very well actually strike the target (albeit ineffectually), and some "hits" might not make contact at all. (Maybe the target pulled a hamstring while avoiding the blow.) Any attack that causes the target to drop dead is likely to be interpreted as a hit. If a PC made the attack, simply note the attack roll's result and announce that the blow connected and slew the target. Let the player puzzle out what happened. If an NPC made the attack, consider how alert the character might be to tricks. Someone very sure of himself might very well believe he made a killing blow, while someone familiar with the caster's reputation might become suspicious if a famous character goes down too easily. Some monstrous foes might try to drag the "slain" character back to their lairs for snacks.`

If a priest casts a defensive spell on a plane near to her power, then goes to another plane farther from her power, would the spell still be active even though she effectively dropped several levels in ability? For instance, a 7th-level priest in my party cast ***magical vestment*** on herself in the Beastlands just prior to entering a portal to the Grey Waste, where she "lost" six levels of ability.

            question: `A ***sword of sharpness*** has a +1 bonus for attack rolls and damage and it severs a limb on a modified roll of 19-21. If a ***sword of sharpness*** had a +3 magical bonus (such as the one carried by Prince Melf Brightflame in the ***From the Ashes*** boxed set), how likely is it to sever a limb? What about a vorpal weapon? Would a ***vorpal sword +5*** sever necks on rolls of 20-25?`,
            answer: [
                `The DM has two options. First, he can assume that the sword severs a limb on any attack roll that totals 19 or more, considering only the sword's +3 bonus; that is, on an attack roll of 16 or more. (Bonuses from Strength specialization, race, combat conditions, and so on never apply to the score to sever.) Alternatively, he can assume the sword severs a limb on an attack roll of 18 or higher, just as a normal ***sword of sharpness*** does. I prefer this option.`,
                `It doesn't matter which option you choose, so long as you apply it consistently. In either case, the attack must succeed to sever a limb. If the sword wielder rolls a 19 and still manages to miss, the sword severs nothing. Note that the actual number required to sever varies with the type of opponent. The base number to sever for a regular ***sword of sharpness*** is 18 for a normal opponent, 19 for an opponent larger than man size, and 20 for solid metal or stone opponents. If you choose the first option, the numbers would fall to 16, 17, and 18.`,

I notice that Table 56: Optional Modifiers to Initiative does not include an entry for undead turning. Does this mean the priest always goes last if he attempts undead turning? That could be pretty rough on a lone priest facing a group of undead.`,
            answer: [

(In the ***PLAYER'S OPTION™*** combat system, a turning attempt is a no-move action.) The priest rolls for initiative normally, and the attempt is resolved during the priest's normal place in the initiative order. There is no entry for turning attempts on Table 56 because undead turning is neither particularly slow nor particularly fast — the priest makes an unmodified initiative roll unless some other factor also applies (see Table 55: Standard Modifiers to Initiative).`,

But you didn't quite handle all his objections. Do you really advocate changing the rules in the middle of the game to restrict player innovation? If not, when should a DM introduce a weight limit for ***frisky chest*** as you suggested? By the way, is it really impossible to stack one's slain or paralyzed comrades on a ***Tenser's floating disk***?`,
            answer: [
                `Of course you shouldn't change the rules during the game; that's just common courtesy. The proper time to introduce rules changes is sometime after the game ends and before the next game begins. It's often helpful to write your rules changes down and keep them handy for future reference. By the way, the ***frisky chest*** spell is due for a major overhaul. In addition to a weight limit (100 Ibs. per caster level), an area of effect reduction also is officially in the works, most likely 10 cubic feet (about 2' x 2' x 2½') instead of a 10' cube. The upcoming ***Priest's Spell Compendium*** will contain the revised spell.`,
                `Yeah, you can carry bodies on a ***Tenser's floating disk***, or just about any other objects or creatures you can heap onto the disk (keeping them there might be a separate problem). On the other hand, you can't use the *disk* as a weapon or a battering ram. It's a load carrier, period. You can't use a disk to bowl over opponents or smash things. A disk just floats around like a blimp, giving no more than a gentle bump when it strikes a creature or object.`,
                `In any case, I certainly hope everyone who reads this column realizes that the DM's task is keeping the game under control without being a spoilsport.`,
                `The reason you ought not to let PCs use ***frisky chest*** spells to make their treasure walk out of the dungeon is because that kind of thinking eventually leads to all kinds of other "innovations" that could make the DM consider more rewarding games — like solitaire. For instance, let's say the party discussed in issue #225 took some of the proceeds from their 10' golden statue and invested in two or three 10' granite statues. Then, they cast ***frisky chest*** on a statue (which weighs in the neighborhood of 3,000 Ibs.), and the party's lead fighter herds it along. Now the party has a statue leading the way wherever it goes. (They also cast a ***continual light*** spell on the statue's upraised hand so that it doubles as a torch bearer.) With the statue in the lead, the party no longer has to fear traps, because the statue will trip them as it walks 3-10' ahead of the group. If the statue falls into a pit, no matter. Someone just hops in after it and the statue flies right out again (assuming the DM isn't going to do anything to stifle player innovation, like require an item save when the statue falls into the pit or put something in the pit that the PCs don't want to jump into).`,
                `While the party chases its frisky statue through the dungeon, anything foolish enough to stand in the party's way finds a ton and half of crushing stone plowing through as the party charges right in. The party might run their ton-and-a-half juggernaut into any door they find, smashing it to flinders. Of course, the spell description says the statue avoids getting with 10' of anyone but the caster, so it couldn't be used to crush opponents, and the frisky item moves only through open space, so it won't smash through barriers. On the other hand, a group that can talk the DM into letting them get away with using ***frisky chest*** as a permanent ***animate object*** probably needn't worry about little things like what the rules say.`,
                `If the party took along an extra ***frisky chest*** spell, they'd have no need for spells like ***Tenser's floating disk***; they need only take any old dungeon door off its hinges and apply ***frisky chest***. The door will galumph along carrying anything the PCs strap or nail onto it.`,
                `Even if the party only used ***frisky chest*** to turn a statue into a trap springer, they still would be getting more mileage out of this 2nd-level spell that they could get out of the 6th-level priest spell ***animate object*** (which has a shorter duration and produces considerable slower movement rates for large objects) or the 5th-level wizard spell ***avoidance*** (which affects only objects with volumes of 27 cubic feet or less).

            answer: [
                `I'd say you've stumbled across an excellent illustration of my point. "Sufficiently advanced" technology becomes indistinguishable from magic because its effects appear so miraculous that an observer can find no rational explanation for them.`,
                `Any 20th-century person with a grade-school education knows something about how a laser works, but if a person from a medieval culture finds a laser and discovers that he can toast bread with it, he's apt to think of it as a magical bread toaster. He has no idea the laser emits a coherent beam of light through the stimulated emission of radiation, and, lacking that knowledge, he's not going to discover laser surgery. If someone else comes along and demonstrates other uses for the laser, the medieval fellow is going to think of the technician as some sort of wizard.`,
                `The difference between technology and magic is this: technology depends on an understanding of reality. Technology works the way it does because someone has thought through a chain of cause and effect that gives a predictable result. For example, a light bulb lights a room because somebody with an understanding of electricity and metallurgy created a situation in which the light bulb must glow brightly when somebody throws the switch.`,
                `Magic, by contrast, does not take advantage of some clever person's knowledge of reality, it literally changes reality to suit the user's taste. In the AD&D game, each spell's ability to change reality is narrowly defined in the spell description. It's helpful to think of any magical spell as a minor *wish* with a predetermined effect. If your character wants light, he casts a ***light*** spell, and he gets light — but that's all he gets. Of course, the character can do some clever things with that light, such as blind somebody by making the light appear on the end of his nose, but no character will ever bake a cake or incubate an egg with the waste heat from the ***light*** spell as one can with an incandescent light bulb, because there isn't any waste heat.`,
                `Spells often prove to have some curious limitations (at least to 20th-century minds). A ***magic missile*** won't affect objects, only creatures. A ***magic missile*** doesn't "know" a creature from an object, but the terms of the spell, just like the terms of a *wish*, allow it to affect only creatures.`,
                `It's important to keep the foregoing in mind when deciding how a spell functions in an unusual situation. Unlike technology, a spell acts in a manner suited to its purpose or it does nothing at all. Consider the frisky chest spell that started this discussion. The spell is supposed to keep intruders' hands off the caster's stuff. Knowing that, it's no great leap of logic to realize that frisky object is going to move in a contrary fashion when somebody starts chasing it around a dungeon.`,
                `In any case, it's incumbent on players to put themselves in a frame of mind suited to the fantasy worlds where their characters live. When playing the AD&D game, you need to think like a person living in a magical world would think, not like a person living in the technological world of the late 20th century would think.`

            question: `I'm sure you've been asked these questions dozens of times, so how about some answers? How do you create psionicist PCs using the rules in the ***Skills & Powers*** book? How do the subabilities from Chapter 2 affect psionicists and wild talents? Can non-psionicists buy wild talents with character points?`,
            answer: [
                `Well, not exactly dozens of times, but often enough (three times in the past month). Here's an unofficial method for building psionicists with character points, largely based on some excellent suggestions from reader Emery Wilson:`,
                `A psionicist receives 35 character points to spend on class abilities. Abilities cost 5-15 points. Any unspent points can be saved to buy proficiencies or saved for use in the game.`,
                `All psionicists use the saving throw and MTHAC0 tables on page 149 of the ***Skills & Powers*** book.`,
                `Psionicists use the THAC0 table on page 149 of the ***Skills & Powers*** book unless they purchase better combat abilities during character creation.`,
                `All psionicists use the experience level table on page 154 of the ***Skills & Powers*** book.`,
                `Psionicists use the Psionic Progression table on page 154 ***Skills & Powers*** book unless they purchase better psychic abilities during character creation.`,
                `Psionicist roll six-sided dice to determine hit points unless they purchase larger hit dice.`,
                `Unless stated otherwise, a character can take each ability only once and only when the character is first created.`,
                `**Armor Use (5/10):** The psionicist can employ small shields and padded, leather, studded leather, or hide armor. As a 10-point ability the psionicist can use small or medium shields, any of the armor types listed above, plus brigandine, chain mail, ring mail, scale mail, or metal lamellar armor. If the psionicist does not take this ability, he can wear no armor and cannot employ shields.`,
                `**Attack Mode of Choice (10):** The psionicist develops extra skill in using one particular psionic attack mode and gains a +1 bonus to mental attack rolls when using that attack mode. This ability is useless without the contact ability.`,
                `**Combat Bonus (10):** The psionicist uses the priest THAC0 chart.`,
                `**Contact (5/10):** The psionicist receives the contact proficiency and gains attack modes as shown on the Psionic Progression table in the ***Skills & Powers*** book. As a 10-point ability, the psionicist receives extra attack modes as though he were two levels higher than his actual level. For example, a 1st-level psionicist would receives two attack modes. The character can never have more than five attack modes. If the psionicist does not take this power, he can purchase the contact proficiency any time he has five character points available.`,
                `**Followers (5/10):** The psionicist become a contemplative master at 9th level. A 1st-level psionicist arrives each month to study with the master. Students serve without pay if they receive at least 10 hours of training each week (they leave to seek new masters if they do not receive sufficient training). The maximum number of students the master attracts is equal to one half the master's Charisma score, rounded down. If the master builds a sanctuary, he can attract a number of students equal to his Charisma score. As a 10-point ability, the psionicist becomes a renowned teacher and can attract students at any level, subject to the limits noted above. If the psionicist does not choose this ability, he never attracts followers, but can hire servants and henchmen for pay just as any other character can.`,
                `**Guarded Mind (5/10):** The psionicist can block or resist attempts to usurp his will and gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws against spells from the enchantment/charm school. As a 10-point ability, the psionicist gains a +2 bonus to all saving throws against spells from the enchantment/charm school.`,
                `**Hit Point Bonus (10):** Psionicists with this ability roll eight-sided dice for hit points rather than six-sided dice. The psionicist still gains only two extra hit points per level at 10th level and beyond.`,
                `**MAC Bonus (10):** The psionicist's Mental Armor Class improves by -1. Note that no MAC value can fall below -10.`,
                `**Mental Defense (5/10):** The psionicist can close his mind to psychic contact and gains defense modes as shown on the Psionic progression table in the ***Skills & Powers*** book. As a 10-point ability, the psionicist receives extra defense modes as though he was two levels higher than his actual level. For example, a 1st-level psionicist receives two defense modes. The character can never have more than five defense modes. If the psionicist does not take this power, he has an open mind, just as if he were a non-psionic character. If the psionicist does not choose this ability at the beginning of play, he can purchase the five-point version whenever he has five character points to spend. The 10-point version is available only at the beginning of play.`,
                `**Penetrating Mind (10):** The psionicist can penetrate physical barriers with his mind more readily than other psionicists can. It takes two inches of lead or iron, four inches of obsidian, or two feet of rock to block the psionicist's clairsentient and telepathic powers. Note that most psionic powers require line of sight; this ability does not negate a blocked line of sight (see ***Skills & Powers***, page 150). This ability has no effect on psionic combat and does not allow the psionicist to ignore magical or psychic barriers that block psionic powers.`,
                `**PSP bonus:** The psionicist has a potent mind and rolls eight-sided dice for psionic strength points instead of six-sided dice. The psionicist still gains only three extra PSPs plus his Wisdom bonus per level at 10th level and beyond.`,
                `**Psychic Adept (10):** The psionicist receives extra powers according to the table below instead of the Psionic Progression table in the ***Skills & Powers*** book. The two disciplines the psionicist chooses at first level count as primary disciplines (see ***Skills & Powers***, page 154).`,

                `**Range Boost (5/10):** The ranges of all powers within the psionicist's primary discipline increase by 25%. If the psionicist is a psychic adept, he has two primary disciplines. At base cost (5), the ranges of only one discipline's powers increase. For a cost of 10 character points, the ranges of powers for both disciplines increase. All powers with ranges of 0, self, or touch remain unaffected by this ability.`,
                `**Warrior Hit Point Bonus (5):** The psionicist gains bonus hit points from a high Constitution score as if he were a warrior.`,
                `**Weapon Specialization (15):** The psionicist can specialize in the use of a particular weapon. This ability is useless unless the character also chooses the weapon use ability (below), even if the psionicist specializes in a martial art or nonlethal combat. The character-point cost for gaining proficiency and specialization in the weapon must be met when the character chooses weapon proficiencies.`,
                `**Weapon Use (5/10):** The psionicist can employ the following small weapons: hand crossbow, dagger, dart, dirk, knife, scourge, sickle, and short sword. As a 10-point ability the psionicist can use any of the weapons above, plus the following slightly larger weapons: short bow, club, light crossbow, hand/throwing axe, javelin, quarterstaff, sling, spear, and war club. If the psionicist does not take this ability, he can employ no weapons at all, relying instead on his mental powers in combat.`,
                `**Psionics and subabilities:** If the rules for subabilities are in play, then Constitution/Fitness, Intelligence/Reason, and Wisdom/Intuition determine a psionicist's PSP total. Wild talent checks use the same set of scores.`,
                `Wisdom/Willpower determines a character's base MAC, and Intelligence/Reason determines a character's MAC modifier.`,
                `**Buying Wild Talents:** A character can purchase a wild talent as a trait for 9 character points. The character need not make a wild talent check, but must roll randomly to determine what the wild talent is (see ***Skills & Powers***, page 156). Note that a character could make a normal wild talent check and use a character point to reroll if the check fails.`

            question: `Does a ***scarab of protection*** allow saving throws against spells such as ***dispel magic*** and ***Mordenkainen's disjunction***? If a character has one of the rare ***scarabs of protection +2***, how do you calculate the saving throw bonus against effects that normally allow no saving throws? For example, a character has a ***scarab of protection +2***, a ***ring of protection +2***, and a ***cloak of protection +2***. What is the character' s saving throw number against a ***magic missile*** spell?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***scarab of protection*** sometimes allows a saving throw against ***dispel magic*** and similar spells, depending on how the spell is used. If a the ***dispel*** is cast directly on the scarab wearer or his items, the wearer has a saving throw and the scarab's bonus applies. (Technically, the items gets the saving throw, but its exactly the same as the wearer's, see the ***dispel magic*** spell description). If a spell such as ***dispel magic***, ***Mordenkainen's disjunction***, or ***continual darkness*** is cast on the area containing the scarab wearer, the wearer gains no saving throw because the spell is not directed at him. The scarab wearer might find it inconvenient — or even fatal — to have spells affecting him *dispelled* or *disjoined*, but that's just a consequence of the spell being there. The situation is similar to what happens when a magic-resistant creature finds itself in one of these spell's areas of effect, there is no magic resistance roll because the spell in question is not working directly against the creature.`,
                `According to the ***scarab of protection*** description, when the wearer is subjected to a spell attack that allows no saving throw, such as ***magic missile***, the wearer gains a saving throw of 20 plus any other magical saving throw bonuses he might have; the character in your example would get a saving throw of 16 against the ***magic missile*** spell no matter what kind of scarab he was wearing. I know of some referees who rule that the base saving throw of 20 accounts for the scarab's first plus (and who give a base saving throw of 19 to characters wearing a ***scarab of protection +2***). This seems a reasonable house rule to me.`

If someone destroys the *phylactery* without destroying the lich first, the lich is deprived of its bolt hole, but remains otherwise unharmed (though it probably gets pretty angry). Note that lich *phylacteries* usually aren't just left lying around, so what your party has might not be the real thing. It might also contain a lich's spirit that's just biding its time until it can seize control of a player character.`,

                `I pointed out two things back in issue #228 that bear on your case. Alas, #228 was the April issue, too late to save you from the horrible fate of being $5.16 (Canadian) poorer: First, "Sage Advice" does not send personal replies, even if you include return postage and a properly addressed envelope. Of course, the good folks at DRAGON® Magazine require you to enclose a coveted SASE (Self Addressed, Stamped Envelope) with any article submission or other piece of correspondence that requires a reply from them, such as a request for submission guidelines. But "Sage Advice" sends no replies and you're wasting your money if you send a SASE to the Sage. In the world of gaming this is what we would call an exception to the general rule. In a rulebook, it might read something like this:`,
                `The "Sage Advice" column does not send personal replies. Readers should not send SASEs with questions for the Sage.`,
                `Now, there are a few little details that our theoretical rulebook writer above left out. (Rulebook writers are always doing this; that's why the Sage has a job.) So here they are: When writing to the DRAGON Magazine staff, you have to send a SASE that is big enough and has enough postage to do the job. You can't send in a 30-page manuscript along with a dinky little envelope and 32¢ (US) postage and expect to get your manuscript mailed back to you when the staff finishes with it. Also, the Sage is not a member of the DRAGON Magazine staff, which is one reason why he doesn't send personal replies. It doesn't make a difference how much return postage you send or how hard you have to strive to drop your question into a mailbox. I'd love to maintain personal correspondence with all my readers, but I'm just one guy with only 10 fingers, and it's just not possible for me to answer everybody's questions individually.`,
                `This whole exception-to-the-rule business confuses people, and each month I get a couple of SASEs. I turn those over to the DRAGON Magazine staff, who stuff the envelopes with writer's guidelines and mail them back. I'll take your word for it that your January letter had a postal reply coupon in it, and I'll pass your current letter on to the DRAGON Magazine folks so that you can get your writer's guidelines, too. I should point out that writing the Sage is a bad way to get writer's guidelines, as your reply will be delayed at least a month, maybe more.`,
                `On to the second useful (but belated) thing from issue #228: Check your back issues for the answer to your question before sending it in. As it happens, I answered your question about ghul lords back in issue #218. See if any of your gaming pals has the issue (in my experience, every group has at least one pack rat who saves copies of anything gaming related). Failing that, check out your local library or game store. If you've got a computer and a modem, you can get the text from issue #218 (and lots of other back issues) from the TSR, Inc. area on America Online (keyword TSR).`

Attacking a sleeping opponent has the same attack modifiers as a backstab according to the new rules in the ***PLAYER'S OPTION™: Combat & Tactics*** and ***Skills & Powers*** books.`,
            answer: [
                `A backstab requires that the thief be behind his target and that the target be unaware of the thief or unaware of the thief's intention to attack. Sleeping characters generally aren't very aware. Many creatures can't be backstabbed at all; however, see the next question.`,

He allows characters to get damage bonuses from backstabbing only if the target creature actually has a spine. He says backstabbing doesn't work against undead at all. Is this right? It seems to me that the damage bonuses ought to apply to anything that has an actual front and back.`,
            answer: [
                `Overall, your DM is being more generous than he has to be. If you read the description of the backstab ability in Chapter 3 of the ***Player's Handbook***, you'll learn that part of the skill involves knowing where to strike. The ***PHB*** goes on to say that a backstab target must be a humanoid with a definable back and that the backstabbing thief must be able to reach a significant target area. So, your DM has expanded the list of possible backstab targets by opening it up to anything with a spine. In either case, your thief character couldn't backstab a roper or beholder.`,
                `Incorporeal undead should remain immune to backstabs, judging from the text in the ***PHB*** (no significant target areas). One could make a similar argument for other undead as well; zombies just don't care if somebody sticks a knife into their kidneys. On the other hand, most undead are humanoid, which is the basic requirement for backstabbing. A skeleton or a ghoul probably is going to find a severed spine inconvenient. In campaigns where the DM strictly limits backstabbing to humanoids, corporeal undead should be susceptible (if they're humanoid). If the DM has loosened up the general restriction (as yours has), there's justification for limiting backstabbing in other ways (as your DM also has).`

            answer: [
                `It all depends on the exact sequence of events and how the fighter is facing relative to the swoop attack. If the swooping creature makes a flank or rear attack, the fighter has no attack at all, because he doesn't threaten the swooping creature.`,
                `If the swooping creature makes a frontal attack, the fighter has his first attack phase as soon as the creature comes within reach (this is not an attack of opportunity). If the swooping creature makes its attack, then flies away in the same round, the warrior gains an attack of opportunity when it leaves. Remember that an attack of opportunity allows one phase's worth of attacks. If the fighter has one weapon, he has one attack. If the fighter has a weapon in each hand, he has two attacks. Each separate attack, however, counts against the maximum number of attacks of opportunity the fighter can make in a single round.`,
                `If the swooping creature attacks the warrior and ends its movement, then uses the withdraw option on the next round, the fighter might not get any more attacks against it, because withdrawing from a threatened area doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.`

For example, a mountain dwarf is size M, giving him a base phase of fast. Does the dwarf slow down to average because his Movement Rate is only 6?`,

                `A characters base movement rate (see ***Combat & Tactics***, page 13) does affect his base initiative phase, as explained on page 18. Note that base movement can be improved by high ability scores (see pages 14 and 15), which can allow dwarves, gnomes, and halflings to avoid the penalty to base initiative because of a movement rate of 6. Note also that you calculate the base initiative adjustment for movement rate before calculating a character's final movement score, which includes encumbrance. Otherwise, you could penalize an encumbered characters base initiative twice, once for his reduced movement rate and once for his encumbrance category.`,
                `Note that the rules on page 18 are intended primarily for monsters, not player characters. Most PCs are supposed to have base initiative phases of fast.

That is, do not treat some dwarves as small creatures (with the attendant limitations on weapon use) just because they happen to be under 4' tall, and don't sock any dwarf with a base initiative of average just because his legs are short.`

            question: `When you dual-class a character, do you pick new weapon proficiencies and nonweapon proficiencies as you would when starting a new character? Bonus proficiencies from a high Intelligence score would not apply, right? Can the character immediately use the nonweapon proficiencies from the general grouping learned under his previous class? Or does he have to wait until the new class's level exceeds the old? What about weapon or nonweapon proficiencies that belong to a grouping allowed to the new character class? If the character learns the same nonweapon proficiency twice, once for the old class and once for the new, what happens when the new class level exceeds the old? Does the character have the old proficiency score plus a bonus for learning it again?`,
            answer: [
                `I'm inclined to favor the simplest possible answer to your questions. A dual-classed character gains no new weapon or nonweapon proficiencies upon choosing a new class. This differs slightly from an answer I gave to a similar question a few years ago, but your question has caused me to reconsider.`,
                `Nonweapon proficiencies really aren't a function of a character's class. The character has full access to all the nonweapon proficiencies he knows (no matter what groups they're from) but doesn't receive any new nonweapon proficiencies until after his level in his new class exceeds his level in the old class. I'm assuming nonweapon proficiencies are something like hit points; the character acquires them by virtue of his class and level, but they aren't really class abilities. Instead, they become part of the character, and the character takes them right along when assuming a new class.`,
                `Weapon proficiencies, on the other hand, are a class function. The character cannot use weapons not normally allowed to his class without forfeiting all experience he would otherwise gain on an adventure. If the character is proficient in a weapon allowed to the new class, he can use it without penalty. If the character is not proficient in any weapons allowed to his new class, he has to struggle along as best he can until his new level exceeds his old one and he can learn to use another weapon. Characters who do a little advance planning will be much better off than characters who leap unprepared into a new profession.`,
                `This answer does not quite conform to the letter of the dual-class rules in Chapter 3 of the ***PHB***, but it sticks to the spirit pretty well and saves both players and DMs a lot of headaches.`

            question: `Under the description of the 2nd-level priest spell ***nap***, from the ***Tome of Magic***, it states that wizards can memorize a new set of spells after benefiting from the ***nap***. But what about priests? Even though it is a priest spell, they are not specifically mentioned as being able to memorize new spells after benefiting from the nap. My current ruling has been that priests receive spells from their deities only once per day (provided they get enough rest before memorizing them), much like many of the other granted spell-like powers. It is not just a question of rest and memorization it is a question of how often the power will grant the request for spells. If it is allowed for priests, then we will likely find a lot of annoyed deities who are getting called upon three or more times a day to grant each one of their priests spells all over again. One of the criteria for priests is Wisdom; this includes enough common sense on how best to use their spells, and not to waste them. Therefore I believe that other than the rest and healing effects of the spell, ***nap***, it has no other effect on priests and their memorization of spells. Is this correct?`,
            answer: [
                `You've offered a darn good logical argument for not allowing priests to learn fresh spells as a result of a ***nap*** spell. On the other hand, nobody is going to use this spell three or more times a day, because characters can ***nap*** only once every 18 hours (see spell description). I'm inclined to follow your logic this far: wizards and bards (who cast wizard spells) can memorize spells immediately after a ***nap***. Rangers, paladins, and priests (including clerics and druids) cannot unless the DM decides the deity who grants the spells has some compelling reason to bestow spells on the characters in question at the time in question. No deity is going to withhold spells from a character who is ready to receive them if the character has been faithful to his alignment and to his deity and who faces a situation in which outcome could affect the deity's interests. Of course, the DM is under no obligation to tell the players whether more spells will be granted when the characters awaken from their ***naps***; the players will have to weigh the risks carefully. In any case, granting extra priest spells after a ***nap*** should be fairly rare; as you point out, no deity looks favorably on a character who's constantly requesting spells just to waste them or use them for self glorification.`,
                `As you point out, this whole discussion begs another question: Just how often can a priest or any other spell caster memorize new spells. The answer is literally as often as the DM is prepared to let them. As long as the character gets a good night's sleep (about eight hours), he can expect to start memorizing new spells whenever he wakes up. It's pretty difficult for anyone to sleep for a full eight hours unless he's been awake and active for the preceding 10 to 14 hours, but exceptions do occur. Priests, as you point out, can be an exception. If the priest has done something to offend his deity, no spells are forthcoming no matter how well rested the priest is.`

            answer: [

That is, a caster backed by 30 other priests could gain 32 spell points a round under normal conditions. Every priest in such a group must be of the same faith.`,

Likewise, a priest might get 1, 2, or 3 extra spells points each round if the spell being cast furthers the deity's ethos or is cast to thwart the interests of an opposing deity. For example, if servants of the deity's greatest enemy are about to break into the inner sanctum of the temple, the caster would gain +3 SP/round in addition to modifiers for location, faith, and offerings.`

            question: `I have a question concerning detecting scrying. The subject matter I read was the ***crystal ball*** description in the ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide*** It seems as if there are two different checks for detection. The first check is a percentage based on class, with a cumulative addition for Intelligence above 12. This I understand. Another sentence says there is a check based the target's level, (e.g., a 9th-level victim would have a 45% chance). Is this second check valid? Should there only be one check using the higher or lower percentage? I'm confused on the matter, and it makes a difference on a campaign we're currently playing.`,
            answer: [
                `A character has only one chance to detect scrying each round. The value for the subjects level or hit dice is added to the base chance, which is determined by class (treat most monsters as fighters) and Intelligence. A 9th-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 18, for example, would have a 74% chance each round (8 + 21 + 45) of noticing the scrying. Note that creatures with Intelligence scores lower than 13 have no chance of detecting the scrying without some kind of magical aid no matter what their hit dice or level.`,

A grand master martial artist inflicts 1d4 hp damage with his bare hands or 1d8 hp damage with his feet.

I feel that if you are going to answer questions that you should at least spend a little bit of time looking for the correct answer. For example there was a question about elven gestation. The answer was that there was no written information on that subject and that it was something for the philosophers. Well, the local idiot said, "I've seen something on elven gestation in the elves handbook." Naturally we didn't believe him. Much to our surprise, though, when we picked up the book there it was. Under the "Life Cycle of Elves." Co figure. I wouldn't have thought to look for something about elves in the elves handbook either. I also enjoy reading your articles in "Sage Advice" where you bash people for asking stupid questions. Now, instead of wasting space for questions about barbarians blowing up powder kegs in treasure rooms with an elven ship, I suggest that you start putting in articles that have relevance to the actual AD&D role-playing game. I would hope to see better information in the future, or I have no reason to subscribe. If the information isn't correct, it doesn't do the subscribers any good.`,
            answer: [
                `Actually, what I said (back in issue #228) was that there is no hard-and-fast rule in the AD&D game for the gestation periods of PC races. And there isn't. I did make mention of philosophers in my answer, but that was regarding whether a lie had been told and had nothing to do with elven gestation.`,
                `Several readers have pointed out that the Complete Book of Elves makes a reference to two-year pregnancies for elves. (It's on page 50, in the Rituals section of Chapter Five: Elven Society; my copy doesn't seem to have a section entitled "Life Cycle.") In any case, I don't regard that as a hard-and-fast rule. The entire book is optional, and as I explained in issue #228, any gestation period much longer than nine months is too long given an elf's body mass. In any case, this is not the kind of "rule" a DM should feel obligated to follow when a player unexpectedly pulls it out of his hat in an attempt to get the DM to change his mind about a decision he has made, which was the situation the reader who submitted the question described.`,

In April, I try to collect the years silliest questions; the reader who posed the elven gestation question asked it in humorous fashion, either by design or by accident. The powder keg question was pretty funny, too. I didn't bash the reader for asking the question. I felt it necessary, however, to rail against campaigns where dragon slaying and the recovery of emeralds the size of thrones supposedly are "everyday" occurrences and that feature powerful items the DM doesn't know how to use in play.

Using two hands, a character can wield a weapon one size larger than himself. No character can use a weapon two or more sizes larger than himself. Since both characters in your example are members of man-sized races, they both can employ long bows using two hands; in this case, one hand on the bow's shaft and one hand on the string (that hand also holds the arrow) counts as two-handed use. Small and tiny creatures, such as gnomes and pixies, cannot use long bows.`,

            question: `How does the signature spell concept from the ***PLAYER's OPTION: Spells & Magic*** book work for sha'irs from the AL-QUADIM® setting? Can they even use it at all? Are they treated as specialists or mages for the purposes of cost in slots or spell points? Normal wizards gain the benefit of one memorization of the signature spell at no cost in spell slots, but that benefit is useless to sha'irs. Would it be reasonable to allow sha'irs the benefit of speeding up their gens' search for the signature spell, say down to the minimum for that spell?`,
            answer: [
                `A sha'ir can designate a signature spell. The sha'ir follows the procedure described on page 57 of ***Spells & Magic*** and must fulfill all the requirements in time, money, and proficiency slots (or character points). The cost is the same as for a mage, and the sha'ir's gen must participate in the process. The signature spell must be one that a native Zakharan wizard of the sha'ir's level can cast. A sha'ir cannot choose a priest spell as a signature spell nor can he choose any spell unknown in the Land of Fate or whose level would be beyond his ability to cast if he were a normal wizard.`,
                `Once the sha'ir and his gen learn the signature spell, the gen can automatically find the spell for the sha'ir once a day without any dice rolls. This once-a-day search always takes the minimum time and always succeeds, no matter what the gen's chance to locate the spell normally would be. The sha'ir can request that the gen make a regular search for the signature spell anytime, but all the rules on page 98 of the ***Arabian Adventures*** book apply to such searches. Whenever the sha'ir receives the signature spell (even if the gen locates the spell through normal means) the sha'ir enjoys all the benefits of a signature spell (a two-level bonus to effective casting level or a -2 penalty to the target's saving throw). If the sha'ir ever loses his gen, he retains the casting benefits but his new gen has no special ability to find the signature spell, though it can be trained to do so at the same cost as establishing a new signature spell.`

            answer: [

If you decide to use these weapons with the standard rules for weapon specialization or any of the optional rules for weapon of choice, weapon expertise, or weapon mastery, the wielder gains all the benefits of the weapon and his level of skill.

Likewise, a wielder should get the bonuses for specialized use only if the wielder actually specializes or achieves mastery with the weapon.

And, since I am invisible, do I have a +4 on my armor class due to being invisible? Why is it that pixies, as monsters, have a 25% magic resistance, but, as a humanoid race, you do not have the magic resistance?`,
            answer: [
                `Pixies have natural invisibility and don't become visible unless they will it or unless forced into visibility in some fashion (a successful ***dispel magic*** against an 8th-level effect can do so, as can mundane actions such as coating the pixie with paint or flour). A failed pick pocket attempt would give the victim a chance to notice the invisible pixie (see the description of the 2nd-level wizard spell ***invisibility*** for details). A melee attack certainly would get an opponent's attention and alert him to the pixie's presence. Neither act makes the pixie visible, however, and any opponents unable to see the pixie suffer the standard -4 attack penalty.`,
                `Noticing an invisible creature and actually seeing it are two different things. If a creature merely notices an invisible creature, it knows approximately where the creature and can attack it but still suffers the attack penalty.

            answer: [
                `I think if a ***wall of force*** had no thickness, it wouldn't have any "edges" to run into. I've never liked the idea of treating ***walls of force*** like monomolecular cutting edges. If that were the case, a ***wall of force*** would be a great addition to any sawmill or stone quarry; just shove the material against the ***wall*** and you get a nice, clean cut. Of course, ***wall of force*** carries a price tag of 5,000 gp per casting. That and its short duration (1 turn plus 1 round per caster level) make it too expensive for "industrial" uses. Nevertheless, a ***wall of force*** is a barrier. It keeps things from passing through it. Now, running into a ***wall of force*** at full speed might hurt, but it shouldn't matter where one strikes it. One merely comes to a sudden stop when one strikes the ***wall***, flat or edge.`,

            answer: [
                `If successfully turned, the paladin must flee from the evil cleric, moving away until the priest is out of sight. If unable to flee, the paladin cannot come within 10' of the priest. If the priest forces the paladin to move closer than 10', or moves within 10' himself, the turning is broken, and the paladin can act normally.`,
                `In the case of an evil priest turning a paladin, the priest calls upon his deity to lend him power. If successful, the priest receives enough power to create an aura so repulsive to the paladin that the holy warrior just goes bonkers and flees the vicinity. it is not a fear effect but a form of spiritual revulsion. Paladins and undead are susceptible to the power of turning because of their special modes of existence (unholy in the case of undead, holy in the case of paladins). Priests, though connected to their deities, are normal mortals and not subject to turning attempts.`,
                `Technically, once a turning attempt succeeds, the affected creature stays away indefinitely, provided the priest who turned the creature maintains his turning effort (that is, the priest must make additional turning actions, but no further rolls, he simply turns the creatures automatically). Undead under an evil priests control remain controlled until destroyed or turned by another priest. If that's too general for you, I suggest the following numbers:`,
                `Paladins remain "turned" for 3d4 melee rounds. After that time their heroic spirits reassert themselves and they can face their nemeses again, though they might be turned again.`,
                `Undead that have been turned or befriended remain that way for 24 hours minus the minimum turning score the priest needed to affect them. If a 10th-level priest turned or controlled a vampire (required turning score of 10), the vampire remains under the priests influence for 14 hours. In the case of a good priest, who must maintain his turning efforts, I'd suggest that "maintenance" be required every 3d4 rounds. For example, Derah, a 10th-level cleric enters a dungeon and turns a vampire. The creature avoids Derah for the next 14 hours. If Derah and the vampire meet each other elsewhere in the dungeon an hour later, Derah must perform a turning action (automatically successful) again to send the vampire away. If Derah and the vampire later become locked in a chamber together, Derah must perform a turning action every 3d4 rounds (again, automatically successful) to keep the vampire at bay.`,
                `Derah's turning actions during this period have no chance for failure, but they consume Derah's attention for the round in which they occur. The DM should not feel obliged to tell the priest when a new turning action is necessary, but a character observing a turned creature might notice a change in its attitude toward the priest.`

Using a magical item (or drinking a potion) counts as a characters sole action for a round; see the What You Can Do in One Round section in Chapter 9 of the ***Player's Handbook*** for details. It's okay for a character who has just used a magical item to exchange a few words with someone or make minor adjustments to his position (a move of 5' or less), but major actions such as attacks, spellcasting, or significant movement have to wait until the next round. It would take the thief in your example at least three rounds to disappear, deliver a backstab, and then disappear again, as follows:`,

                `The "correct" answer here is whatever makes you, the DM, feel comfortable. A crushing blow saving throw with a -2 penalty seems severe enough to me. On the other hand, the core AD&D rules use an abstract combat system with hostilities proceeding at the glacial pace of one set of actions every minute. In such a system, a "parry" might not involve the two weapons touching at all. The character with the rapier might just stick the weapon's point in his opponents face. Then again, you can treat the one-minute increment as just an arbitrary way to keep track of time in the game (combat really proceeds much more quickly). In that case, a "parry" could be considered an attempt to physically block the attacker's blow. In that case, a more substantial item saving throw penalty might be in order, say -4.

            question: `A druid in my game recently found that when summoning a fire elemental (with the 6th-level spell ***conjure fire elemental***) he had a 4% chance to get an efreeti. He then proceeded to cast the ***conjure fire elemental*** spell at every opportunity — usually during rest periods in town — and when an efreeti actually arrived, he demanded three wishes from the creature. He continued to do this until all his ability scores were 25. Is this something all druids do or just a slip in the rules found and exploited by my resident rules lawyer? Do you have any suggestions for preventing every new player character in my campaign from becoming a druid and repeating the process?`,
            answer: [
                `Let's pause for a brief aside before we begin. Are you aware that increasing all a character's ability scores to 25 would require at least 660 *wishes* assuming that all the character's ability scores started at 18? That's because a *wish* never raises an ability by more than a full point. Actually, a *wish* often does not raise an ability by a full point at all. The wishing character gains a full point only when the affected ability score is 15 or less. If the ability score is 16 to 20, it takes ten *wishes* to raise it one point and if the score is 21 or more it takes 20 *wishes* to raise it a full point. See chapter 1 of the ***DMG*** for details on this rule (though the part concerning ability scores of 21 or more has been erroneously dropped from the most recent printings). Anyway, your druid would have to cast ***conjure fire elemental*** something like 5,500 times to get that many *wishes* from efreet.`,
                `So, the first way to prevent players from abusing ***conjure fire elemental*** is to make them play out each casting of the spell. It's a good bet the other players in your group will resent all the time this little charade is wasting and will intervene to stop smart aleck. If not, it's an even better bet that some local is going to object to the parade of fire elementals (in a medieval town, a being composed of elemental fire can do a whole lot of damage without even trying) and put an end to the druid's shenanigans permanently.`,
                `Of course, efreet are not the most agreeable creatures in the multiverse. If an efreeti appears in response to a ***conjure fire elemental*** spell, it expects to find the druid in real trouble or faced with some grave difficulty. If capriciously asked for a *wish* or three, the creature will ask what the *wish* is. If it the *wish* is something the efreeti can pervert in some way, it will do so — just to teach silly priest a lesson. If the *wish* is reasonably airtight, the efreeti simply stalls until the spell's duration (one turn per caster level) ends, and then it leaves, probably vowing to get revenge someday.`,
                `Seeing as how the efreet in your campaign have seen fit to humor the druid, I can only guess that they have some unpleasant surprise in store for him. Put yourself in the efreet's place and try to think up some way to get even with this presumptuous mortal. Perhaps the efreet need an agent to perform a long and arduous task (or series of tasks) on the Plane of Elemental Water (hardly prime terrain for efreet). Perhaps the druid should wake up one morning and find that he has to consume a couple of thousand gold pieces worth of rare gems each day to maintain his superhuman existence (the actual amount should slowly increase over time). Perhaps both of these events — and several more — await the character. It's possible that some efreeti has decided to enslave the druid and has arranged to boost all his ability scores so he'll make a better servant. A party of efreet might even now be forming up to capture the druid and haul him off to the City of Brass, where his penchant for calling fire elemental creatures into service will undoubtedly be amply "rewarded."`,
                `In any case, the character should discover that he can keep his increased ability scores only so long as he agrees to whatever the efreeti propose. If the druid tries to escape his fate through the use of another *wish*, the attempt should either fail or strip him of his boosted abilities.`

            question: `In the past, I have not considered ***bracers of defense*** as true armor. This is presently causing some difference of opinion. I have just introduced the character generation rules from the ***Skills & Powers*** book and I'm allowing the players to rework their existing characters. Most of the characters already have ***bracers of defense*** and their players now want to choose a limitation on armor to gain extra character points. Of course, the magical bracers would make the (imitation irrelevant. So, are ***bracers of defense*** armor? In this case, it seems to me they are. Can wizards wear ***bracers of defense***? How do ***bracers of defense*** affect thief abilities? If you print my question in the magazine, I would appreciate it if you would make reference somehow to the statement in the ***Player's Handbook*** that says, "Armor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best (very powerful magical armors." This implies a limit of 10 for armor class — yes? Please? Pretty Please? With sugar on top? Would you be offended if I offered a small token of my appreciation?`,
            answer: [
                `***Bracers of defense*** are not a type of armor; characters normally prohibited from wearing armor, such as wizards, can use them. Thieves wearing ***bracers of defense*** are considered unarmored for purposes of modifying their thief skill scores.`,
                `On the other hand, when using the ***Skills & Powers*** character generation rules you should not allow any character to claim extra character points for a limitation that does not actually affect him. I recommend that you tell your players the "no armor" limitation isn't available to them — even the ones that don't own ***bracers of defense***. Whenever you apply a complex rule retroactively, you've got to be careful lest you alter your game too much. In this case, you probably don't want characters. who've been wearing armor to suddenly give up the habit. Your players should be selecting abilities that reflect their characters' game histories.`,
                `You are correct in assuming that -10 is the limit for Armor Class in the AD&D® game. There are a few creatures that exceed the limit, but characters have to stick to it.

            question: `One of the players in my game has an ***apparatus of Kwalish***. He uses it above ground (since it can *levitate*) and tows it with a horse (since it can't, move very quickly on its own). He is almost always in it. In fact the character sleeps in it and hoards all his treasure and equipment in it — right now it contains about two dozen unstrung longbows. The character takes cover in the ***apparatus*** during every encounter, where, the player says, no attacks can reach him. If that weren't bad enough, we're now engaged in an argument over exactly how much damage the thing can sustain. The item description says 200 hp damage is enough to stave in a side. But the player argues that the ***apparatus*** has more than one side. Finally, I ruled that 400 hp damage would destroy the ***apparatus***. The player said no big deal, he'll just take it to a blacksmith and have the ***apparatus*** patched up. Since when would a blacksmith be able to patch up a magical item? What would he use to do it? A blowtorch? I know that a ***Daern's instant fortress*** can't be repaired except with a *wish*.`,
            answer: [
                `First, although the item description for the ***apparatus of Kwalish*** includes a table that uses the term "levitate," the item is actually a miniature submarine and has no ability to rise into the air. The ***apparatus*** can move on land by walking on its mechanical legs, but only at rate of 3; the backward rate of 6 depends on the combined action of the device's legs and tail, and it works only in water.`,
                `If the ***apparatus*** suffers 200 hp damage, one side collapses and the device becomes completely inoperative.`,
                `It would be entirely reasonable to require a *wish* to repair damage to the apparatus, but the DM might allow an armorer (not just a blacksmith) to repair the device at the rate of one hit point a day. Each point repaired should cost 150-200 gp (for unusual materials, special fuels, and intense labor). Also, the armorer should make one proficiency check, and the ***apparatus*** should attempt a saving throw vs. crushing blow (an ***apparatus of Kwalish*** makes item saving throws as metal, with a +2 bonus). Make the proficiency check first, at the beginning of the process. If the check fails, the armorer cannot repair the current damage to the particular apparatus he's working on, though he could try to repair another ***apparatus*** or new damage to the current ***apparatus***. Make the saving throw at the end of the process; if the device fails its item saving throw, something goes awry and the item ceases to function, regardless of the success or failure of the repair attempt.`,
                `Also, you might note that the ***apparatus*** can hold only two man-sized creatures. There might not be room inside for the character and all his treasure equipment, especially if it includes about two dozen long bows.`,

            answer: [
                `If your campaign allows shields to function as weapons, then an enchanted shield counts as a magical weapon when used to attack — the item has a magical aura that can overcome an opponents resistance to normal weapons.`,

            question: `I have been reading "Sage Advice" for some time now. And I wish you to keep up the good work I would like to give my own interpretation on the ***frisky Chest*** spell as discussed in issue #225. The problem was that the DM thought the spell would have to cause the object to run from the players who were trying to get it out of the dungeon. Think on this, the spell was made to stop people from stealing the object it is cast on, so the only thing that should cause the statue to move is a titan or large dragon. I mean, what character, or even group of 10 characters, is able to steal a statue that weighs several tons? Try this next time the players use that ploy. When they go up to "spook" the statue into moving, have it just stay there. If you really want to be cruel have the statue scare them into backing off. What player wouldn't have his character run from a giant statue of gold that could squish him like a bug. I would not let the players use this to create golems, but it will stop them from stealing the statue.`,
            answer: [
                `I think players who cast ***frisky chest*** on a statue might have reason to gripe if the statue moves toward them. On the other hand, the deity granting the spell might object to the spell's misuse and decide to play with the characters' minds a little.`,

The DM also can suggest an ability check if a the party's failure to solve a riddle or puzzle threatens to derail the adventure. The DM should decide how difficult the solution is and assign an appropriate modifier to the ability check. It usually best to allow the party only one roll to find the solution, though if several characters are working on the problem, you can allow the character making the check a bonus, say +1, for each helper. As an alternative, you could allow each character involved with the riddle a roll but require a certain number of successes for the party to solve the riddle as a group. In any case, if the roll fails the group should have to wait at least a day before attempting another roll.

                `It's true that hit points a character gains as he rises in level do not represent the character's slow transformation into a mass of indomitable flesh. Instead, the characters resistance to damage comes from an increasing ability to avoid fatal injury through skill or just plain luck. A high-level character who has endured a series of blows still collects his share of cuts and bruises, but the blows that delivered those cuts and bruises would have slain a lesser mortal. Consider two characters, one with 10 hit points and one with 110 hit points. If the first character suffers two hits that each inflict five hp damage, he has one or two very large wounds and the damage to his body is either mortal or life threatening (depending on what optional rules the campaign uses). If the character with 110 hit points suffers 20 five-point hits, he has around 20 minor cuts, scrapes, and bruises, but remains otherwise healthy.

Such as Teziirian Rogue Pugilists? Or Waterdhavian Enchanter Nobles? Can the geographical kits be used in conjunction with the kits from the ***Planewalkers Handbook***? Or is this a benefit that only Toril's primes are privy to? The possibility of planewalker scouts, explorers, or even diplomats sounds tantalizing.`,

            question: `When using the channeling and fatigue rules from the ***Spells & Magic*** book, how are Quest spells (clerics) and True Dweomers (wizards and clerics) handled? Does the use of a priests spell-like granted power cause a cleric to become fatigued? If so, what level of fatigue does the priest suffer? Do creatures who have innate spell-like abilities suffer from fatigue when they use these powers? If so, what level of fatigue do they suffer?`,
            answer: [
                `True Dweomers never become available through the expenditure of spell points or the use of channeling. That is, characters of less than 20th level and 18 Intelligence (or Wisdom) cannot use spell points to cast True Dweomers. Neither can a character normally allowed to cast True Dweomers increase the number of True Dweomers available on a given day through the use of channeling or spell points. Preparing or casting a True Dweomer does not cause a channeler fatigue, but the channeler must be fresh (suffering from no fatigue penalties at all) to prepare or cast a True Dweomer.`,
                `Quest spells are similar to True Dweomers in that characters cannot acquire them through channeling or the expenditure of spell points—Quest spells only come as a direct favor from a priests deity.

                `Likewise, a priests granted powers and the innate spell-like abilities of certain creatures function independently of spell points or channeling.

            question: `Page 28 of the ***Complete Book of Humanoids*** says that Firbolgs inflict double damage when using weapons of their own make, provided they wield them in both hands. Now, Table 7 (from the back of the book) lists the giant-kin mace at 1d8 x 2/1d6 x 2 and the giant-kin two-handed sword at 1d10 x 2/3d6 x 2. Are these damage amounts doubled because of the Firbolg's special ability or because they are double sized versions of human-sized weapons? if it is the latter, then why aren't the giant-kin halberd and dagger listed as "x 2" instead of raising the damage die (which is how they appear on Table 7). if the former, does the damage get doubled again if Firbolgs use them two-handed?`,
            answer: [
                `There doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern to the damage ratings given on Table 7. As you point out, the damage ratings for maces and two-handed swords seem to reflect the Firbolg racial ability to cause double damage; but, the arrow, dagger, and halberd seem to have been "upgunned" to reflect their larger size.`,

If a Firbolg character wants to claim his racial damage bonus, he can double only the man-sized damage rating for these weapons. See the answer to the next question for details.`

            question: `The Complete Bard's Handbook lists thief/gypsy-bard as an allowable multi-class combination. What thief skills do these characters have, and how do you calculate the skill scores? If two skills are the same, do you just use the higher one?`,
            answer: [
                `A thief/gypsy-bard would have the eight basic thief skills from Table 26 in the ***Player's Handbook*** (***PHB***). To determine the base score for each skill, compare Table 26 in the ***PHB*** to Table 7 in the ***Complete Bards Handbook***; take the higher of the two base scores if both tables show the same skill. Give the thief/gypsy-bard 40 discretionary points to round out his skills, then adjust all skills for race, Dexterity, and kit. As the character increases in level, add further discretionary points as the character earns them. That is, the character adds 30 points each time he gains a level as a thief and 15 points each time he gains a level as a bard.`,

            question: `Some spells listed in the ***PHB*** and *DRAGON® Magazine* are capable of being (and are supposed to be) cast for persons other than the caster. Others are somewhat ambiguous as to whether they can work for someone other than the caster, ***find familiar*** being one of them. Can ***find familiar*** be cast for someone other than the caster (such as a master wizard on behalf of an apprentice)? What if the spell recipient is not a spellcaster (or at least not a wizard spellcaster)? What kind of benefits (if any) would he or she receive? And what about other spells, such as the ***animal companion*** spell? The description infers that the spell is for the caster, but the information in the "statistics" portion says that the area of affect is the creature summoned. Which takes precedence? The text of the description or the stats?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***find familiar*** spell allows the caster to summon a familiar and bind the creature to himself. The caster cannot assign the familiar to anyone else.`,
                `Neither a spell's statistics nor its description "take precedence" when trying to decide whether a spell can be cast on another's behalf. One must use common sense. In most cases, the spell's description is far more useful than its statistics because the text tells you what the spell does. For example, ***dispel magic*** cancels other magic within its area of effect. It makes no difference who casts the spell. On the other hand, ***charm person*** makes the recipient loyal to the caster. A character might wish to *charm* someone on another character's behalf, but the recipient feels loyal to the caster, not to some third person the caster designates.`,
                `Sometimes, however, a spell's statistics can settle the issue pretty well. Any spell with a range of "touch" can be cast for another's benefit. On the other hand, a spell with a range of "0" always affects the caster, and any powers the spell grants cannot be transferred elsewhere no matter what the spell's description might imply; the spell's area of effect might be large enough to affect multiple creatures, but if the range is 0 the spell always must be centered on the caster.`,
                `Perhaps the statistics for the ***find familiar*** spell should read: Range: 0; Area of Effect: 1 creature within a radius of 1 mile per caster level.`

            question: `Your recent attention to ***frisky chest*** and similar spells has suggested a possible flaw in the ***Tenser's floating disc*** spell to me: What sort of surface do you recommend for the floor that the disk needs to be above? It would seem to be incredibly easy for someone simply to throw a weighted rock across a chasm and use the disk to ferry people across without causing the disk to disappear due to the lack of floor, simply by using a thick rope. This would seem to reduce the use of ***telekinesis*** or ***fly*** as a lot of the effects that these are commonly used for are superseded by the increased duration of the ***disk*** and the fact that it can be used on inanimate objects such as burning flasks of oil, as long as they are within the spell range. Images of hoards of low-level mages arriving in town sitting on disks, and of sneaky mages getting the disks to carry caltrops and acid into dangerous areas and then causing the disk to disappear by causing it to rise more than three feet from the ground come to mind.`,
            answer: [
                `If you want to restrict abuse of ***Tenser's floating disc*** heavily, you can simply rule that the disc winks out unless the surface beneath it is capable of supporting a normal human walking at a normal pace. This rules out not only ropes but also water, quicksand, lava, and all sorts of surfaces the caster might encounter while using the spell. For most campaigns, however, a more reasonable ruling might require a surface that could conceivably support the empty disc itself assuming it were a physical object. Tightropes would still be out, but water (at least calm water), mud, quicksand, and the like would be okay.`,
                `As a method for scattering items on the ground, a ***Tenser's floating disc*** would be useful in some cases, but not in others. The caster himself, for example, could strew caltrops much more efficiently than the disc could because the disc would drop the whole load in the same small (about three feet wide) area. Anyone encountering the resulting pile of caltrops probably would see them and easily avoid them.`,
                `Flaming oil won't work particularly well with the disc either. One flask of oil makes a puddle three feet wide (see Table 45 in the ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide***), which is exactly the width of the disc. The disc is slightly concave, so it should carry the oil along without sloshing. A second flask, however, would overflow the disc—it's *slightly* concave. Further, lighting the oil and moving it into position will cause only minimal damage to whatever happens to be underneath when the ***disc*** vanishes—very little will actually be under the ***disc***, as it never floats more than three feet off the ground. Also, remember that a direct hit from burning oil inflicts 2d6 hp damage on the first round. If a party fills a disc with oil, lights it, then drops it somewhere, the best they should get is a splash hit (1d3 hp damage). Since the oil is splashing, I'd make every creature within five feet of the point of impact attempt a saving throw vs. paralysis to avoid the damage. It's possible that a tiny creature—or an immobilized one—could suffer a direct hit, but if the party lights the oil before moving the ***disc***, then the damage still should be only 1d6. If the party dumps the oil from the disc, then lights it, they could inflict the full 2d6 hp damage, provided the target is small enough and slow enough to be under the disc when it vanishes.`,
                `The ***disc*** could carry quite a lot of acid or holy water, say five vials worth. Still, the disc floats only three feet off the ground and moves at a fairly poky movement rate of 6. Again, the best the party can hope for is a splash. In this case, I'd recommend a saving throw vs. paralyzation for every creature within five feet of the point of impact, with failure resulting in 1d3 splash hits (1 hp damage each). Of course, an immobile creature caught under the disc would suffer five hits (2d4 hp damage each).`,
                `All the foregoing might seem stingy, but there may very well be cases where the party is better off forcing the opposition to attempt saving throws rather than trying to score missile hits, and there's no chance of the containers failing to break. Also, opponents with no room to move out of the ***disc's*** way would just be splashed, no saving throws.`

If the wizard also has access to the wizardly school of necromancy, he also can learn ***animate dead*** as a fifth-level spell. The limits given in the spell descriptions are for each casting of the spell, not for the total number of creatures the character can have animated at once. (DMs usually find various clever ways of making players regret collecting too many animated allies for their characters). Finally, both the priest and wizard versions of the spell use total hit dice of the animated creatures to determine how many creatures one spell can animate. In both cases, the caster can animate one hit die worth of skeletons or zombies per caster level. The description for the priest version implies that priests can animate one zombie per caster level, but that's an error. Both versions of the spell work just as described under the wizard version.`,

            answer: [
                `A dragon under the effects of an ***inverted ethics*** spell would temporarily lose its desire to hoard treasure and probably would become less jealous of what it had. Unlike the shopkeeper used as an example in the spell description, a dragon wouldn't allow people just to take treasure from its horde, because it's not in the habit of letting treasure leave the hoard. On the other hand, an ***inverted ethics*** spell also would temporarily transform an evil dragon from a suspicious, haughty, and violent creature into a trusting, humble, and mild one. The transformation might just allow a party to exchange a few pleasantries with the dragon and hit the road with their skins still intact. If anyone was foolish enough to take an item from the hoard while the dragon wasn't itself is most likely in for a heap of trouble when the spell wears off and the dragon comes looking for its missing trinkets.`,

            question: `I am playing an inquisitor paladin from ***The Complete Paladin's Handbook***. My question pertains to two of the kit's special benefits, namely the ability to detect evil magic and dispel evil magic. What, exactly, is evil magic? Is any magic cast by an evil character "evil?" Does that mean that if my character encounters a ***long sword +1***, he can destroy the sword if an evil wizard created it? What about other types of spells? The inquisitor's dispel evil magic ability has a base success chance of 100% making it very potent indeed.`,
            answer: [
                `In this case "evil magic" is any magic cast by an evil creature. However, the magic must be a spell or spell-like ability still operating. For example, an inquisitor cannot detect or dispel a ***cure light wounds*** spell an evil character has cast because the magic is only fleeting; only its effects are permanent. Nor could an inquisitor dispel a ***flesh to stone*** spell an evil creature has cast. (Exactly which spells have instantaneous durations but permanent effects is subject to some debate, and any listing of such spells can vary from campaign to campaign.) The inquisitor could detect and dispel an evil caster's ***charm person*** or ***curse*** spell, however.`,

Technically, the beholder eye ability duplicates a ***death spell*** except that it affects only one creature at a time, just as you point out. If you're following the rules to the letter, that means a beholder's death ray slays creatures of 8+3 hit dice or less without a saving throw. Such creatures cannot be raised or resurrected (see the opening lines of the spell description).

                `Once the mental change takes place, a polymorphed creature gains all the assumed form's abilities: Hit Dice, Armor Class, combat abilities, magical abilities, and so on.

An elf's resistance does not apply to effects that allow limited control or impose a disability, such as ***command***, ***hold person***, ***suggestion***, ***quest***, or ***geas***.

Since "Injected" means it must be put directly in the bloodstream, I think any successful hit (at least 1 hp damage) will count as the poison being injected, since that hit has drawn blood. (You don't coat your hammer with poison.) I know the creature struck has to attempt a saving throw vs. poison, but what damage will the poison cause if the saving throw fails? What happens if the saving throw succeeds? Does the amount of damage the blow inflicted have any effect on what the poison does? Also, how long does the poison last once it's applied to a weapon, and how long does it take to poison a weapon?`,
            answer: [
                `Yes, Injected poisons can be "injected" with a successful attack by a piercing or slashing (type P or S) weapon coated with the venom. For game purposes, blunt (type B) weapons can't inject poison. While not every "hit" in AD&D game combat necessarily draws blood, it's best to require a creature struck by a poisoned weapon to attempt a saving throw vs. poison anytime a poisoned weapon hits and inflicts damage; though the DM could introduce some additional mechanic, such as a minimal amount of damage (say at least 3 hp damage) or a high attack roll (perhaps a attack roll of 16 or higher or an attack score at least three points higher than the minimum needed to score a hit).`,
                `Once the attack delivers the poison, the rules on poison from the ***DMG*** (Chapter 9) take over, and any damage the weapon inflicted becomes moot. Just roll the saving throw and apply the result. Note that most poisons can inflict some small amount of damage even if the recipient makes a successful saving throw.`,
                `The DM has to decide how long a poison remains dangerous once applied to a weapon. I suggest no less than one turn and no more than one day. Use the shorter time for simple liquids that the user just slaps on and the longer time for specially prepared venoms that won't rub off or evaporate readily. One successful hit with a poisoned weapon should effectively wipe off all venom, as should exposure to large volumes of water, intense heat, or similar conditions that could remove the venom.`,
                `It takes a full round to apply venom to a weapon (no movement or other significant actions allowed), and a character can apply poison that quickly only if the poison is readily at hand. Small weapons, such as arrows or quarrels can be envenomed 10 at a time.`,
                `Many referees I know require characters carrying poisoned weapons to attempt saving throws vs. poison every turn or hour to see if the character has scratched himself or had some similar mishap.

Sizes are assigned by race, and elven chain mail has its own table. There is no six-inch adjustment. If the armor fits a character's race, it fits the character.

All magical boots expand or shrink to fit wearers from halfling to giant size (see the notes on categories of miscellaneous magical items in the ***DMG***). Beyond these specific examples, there is no general rule for item sizes. Your DM can decide that on his or her own. In campaigns where magic is rare, its best to allow considerable latitude in this matter; otherwise, the PCs won't be able to use what little magic they find. In some cases, an item will fit a large range of creatures without altering its size at all.

                `Below is a chart. The column to the left shows the type of demihuman trying to wear the armor. The rows along the top show what species the armor was made for. The percentage chances shown are the chances that the person can wear the armor, and the "+" and "–" symbols show whether the armor is more likely to be too big or too small for the wearer. (If there is no such symbol, it means that odds are even, 50% that it will be too big, 50% that it will be too small.) "Too large" could mean that it is so baggy or empty that it hinders the wearer and does not protect him well enough, or that it is so long on him that it interferes with his walking. "Too small" could mean that it is not broad enough to accommodate the wearer's chest, or that it is so short that it looks ridiculous and docs not sufficiently protect the wearer.`,

                `However, the DM may allow the difference in sex to help sometimes—in cases where the armor is not likely to fit a male human because it is too small in the shoulders and chest. A human woman trying to put on a male half-elf's armor might be at no modifier, and find herself at a + 10% modifier to wear a male elf's armor.`,
                `Remember that full plate has its own modifiers for chances to fit: it has only a 20% chance to fit another member of the same race (10% ff the new wearer is of the other sex). A character *cannot* wear full plate made for a character of another race, period.`,
                `The DM can allow previously role-played determinations of a character's height and build to affect the chances from the chart below. For instance, if one player has always said that his human character was short and stocky. say 5'4" and powerfully built, so that many people joked about him having a dwarvish ancestor, the DM can give him a + 15% chance to wear dwarvish armor: this raises his chance from 50% to 65%, as if he were a human trying to wear armor of his own kind. The DM should, however, subtract that same modifier from the character's chance to wear armor built for humans: that chance would go down from 65% to 50%.`,

            question: `When using the ***PLAYER'S OPTION™*** combat system from the ***Combat & Tactics*** book, how do you decide exactly when a character attacks when he uses two weapons? Let's say a character uses two long swords (being ambidextrous and a two-weapon style specialist). The section on phases states that both long swords will hit in the average phase. If that is the case, what happens if the creature being attacked dies from damage caused by the first weapon? Is the person required to follow through with the second attack and waste it (as that was his declared action), or can he redirect his other attack on a nearby creature that phase or at a later phase that same round. My reasoning here is that both attacks occur simultaneously and therefore hit at the same time (or so close together as to be simultaneous for game purposes) and that a character can't really tell which one was the killing blow quickly enough to switch targets in one round. Another person in the gaming group reasons that a character wouldn't follow through with an obviously futile attack when there are more pressing concerns in a fight (that is, other foes). Any help you could give me regarding this would be immensely helpful.`,
            answer: [
                `Which one of you is the DM? That person is "right."`,
                `I'm inclined to favor something like your first suggestion. The character has to declare where his two attacks are going. If that results in overkill, too bad. The character could opt to delay one attack until a later phase, but he's got to do that before he sees the results of the first attack.`,
                `In cases where a character uses two weapons that don't have identical speeds, the combined attack comes on the slower of the two phases and still occurs (effectively) simultaneously. In any case, if the character wielding two weapons is threatening two or more opponents, he can direct his two attacks at two different opponents, but must decide to do so before rolling any dice to resolve the attacks.`

            question: `Can you explain exactly how to assign hit points, proficiencies, class abilities, and armor to multi-classed characters?`,
            answer: [
                `A multi-classed character's abilities are subject to considerable debate, even at TSR, inc. Here are some recommendations and observations on the matter:`,
                `For hit points, roll all the PC's Hit Dice, adjust each die for Constitution, and note the total somewhere. A character's hit-point rating is the average of all the dice (the total divided by the character's number of classes). Drop all fractions, but don't discard the total (you'll use it to help determine the character's hit points as she gains levels). Each time the character gains a level, roll the appropriate hit die, adjust for Constitution, and add it to the recorded total. Recalculate the character's hit points by dividing the new total by the character's number of classes, again dropping any fractions. This method is different from the procedure given in Chapter 3 of the ***Player's Handbook*** (***PHB***), and it gives multi-classed characters a few more hit points as they advance in level (because the practice of keeping a running total of all hit dice rolled allows fractional hit points to build up instead of being lost to rounding down).`,
                `Multi-classed characters gain all the abilities from their classes (except armor and weapon use—see below). A character can use only one ability at a time, however, and cannot combine abilities as part of a single action. A fighter/mage, for example, cannot make a melee attack while casting a spell, though she could use her fighter THAC0 when targeting spells that require attack rolls. A thief making a backstab attack must use her thief THAC0 to get her attack and damage bonuses (selecting just the right spot to hit puts a crimp on her overall fighting ability).`,
                `Except as noted above, a multi-classed character uses the best THAC0 from her classes.`,
                `A multi-classed character always uses the best available saving throw from all her classes.`,
                `To assign proficiencies to a multi-classed character, choose the highest number of initial proficiencies from among all the character's classes. Thereafter assign a new proficiency whenever the character would normally earn them for each class. (This, too, is a departure from the ***PHB*** method.) The character can freely choose non-weapon proficiencies from any group allowed to any one her classes. For example, a fighter/thief could chooses from the General, Warrior, and Rogue groups. Weapon proficiencies work the same way, except where noted below.`,
                `Multi-classed characters generally must abide by the worst armor restrictions among their classes. Multi-classed elf and half-elf mages can wear elven chain mail if one of their other classes is normally allowed to use chain mail. Multi-classed thieves suffer penalties to their abilities if they wear armor better that leather. Elven chain mail, padded armor, and leather armor impose the penalties noted on Table 29 in the ***PHB***. Other types of armor negate all thief abilities except Open Locks and Detect Noise (these abilities still suffer the penalties from the "Padded or Studded Leather" column on Table 29). Note that the ***Complete Thief's Handbook*** extends Table 29 to cover most types of armor. (I personally don't like this rule very much. I prefer to allow multi-classed characters to wear the best available armor, except for thieves, who suffer the penalties noted above if they wear heavy armor.)`,
                `Multi-classed characters generally enjoy the best weapon selection from among all their classes, except for priests, who remain bound by their priest weapon restrictions. (I don't care for this rule, either, and prefer to allow any multi-classed character to choose weapons form those available to all their classes.)`

In the spell description and the statistics of the ***fireball*** spell, there are two different figures to go by: one is a 20' radius, and the other (in the description) is 33,000 cubic feet (33 10' × 10' × 10' cubes).

            question: `How does the second-level Wizard spell ***choke*** (from the first volume of the ***Wizard's Spell Compendium***) supposed to work? From the way that the spell is worded, the target receives no saving throw to resist the spell, just against the damage for half. Is that correct? If a successful save doesn't negate the spell, what happens when is cast on a spellcaster? That same caster could not cast any spells for the duration of the ***choke*** spell, right? The ***choke*** spell lasts one round per caster level, the target always suffers damage every round, and a spellcaster cannot cast spells in a round he takes damage. Is it possible for ***choke*** to inflict no damage at all? The base damage is 1d4 hp damage, so what happens if the die roll is a 1? Does that round down to no damage, possibly giving the target a chance to cast a spell?`,
            answer: [
                `The victim of a ***choke*** spell gains a saving throw, but success only reduces the damage by half. Note that you round fractions up when calculating half damage from the spell (see spell description), so the victim always takes at least one point of damage each round the spell lasts. Note that the target attempts the saving throw the moment the spell is cast, and the result applies to the entire duration of the spell.`,
                `If you're using the combat rules in the ***PHB***, allow a spellcaster affected by a ***choke*** spell (or any other from of continuing damage) a normal initiative roll each round. If he wins, he can cast a spell (he still takes damage, but managed to get a spell off before any damage took effect). If the target loses initiative, the choking disrupts spellcasting during that round.`,

            answer: [
                `Actually, ***locate object*** falls into the same category as effects as ***clairvoyance*** and ***clairaudience***; it bypasses the wall entirely. ***Detect magic*** allows the caster to detect magical auras. In many campaigns, the spell makes auras visible, but that's window dressing, not part of the spell description. A ***detect magic*** spell's area of effect will not extend through a ***wall of force*** any more than it can extend through a metal wall (though the spell will reveal the wall's magical aura). On the other hand, spells such as ***detect invisibility*** and ***true seeing*** make things visible so long as they are within range and in the caster's line of sight.

                `A *symbol* has no effect unless the caster places it in plain sight and in a prominent location.`,
                `As a default, a *symbol* is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as selected by the spell caster: reads, touches, or passes over the rune, looks at the rune, or passes through a portal bearing the rune.`,
                `In this case, "reading" the rune means any attempt to study, identify, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol to render it invisible and inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To trigger a *symbol*, a creature must be within 60 feet of the rune.`,
                `The caster can set special triggering conditions of his own. These can be as simple or elaborate as the caster desires. Special conditions for triggering a symbol can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. For example, a *symbol* can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.`,
                `A *symbol's* triggering conditions are always defensive in nature. A touch-triggered symbol remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.`,
                `Once cast, a *symbol's* triggering conditions cannot be changed. The caster ignores the effects of his own symbols and cannot inadvertently trigger them.`,
                `When triggered, a *symbol* affects all creatures within a 60' radius, except for the caster and any individuals attuned it (see below). If a *symbol* has a pass phrase, anyone using it remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the individual remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the character leaves the radius and returns later, he must use the pass phrase again. Once triggered, a symbol remains active until its duration expires; creatures that subsequently meet an active *symbol's* triggering conditions suffer its effects.`,
                `A *symbol* can be quickly drawn in the air or on some surface, or it can be carefully inscribed on a surface.`,
                `A quickly drawn *symbol* has a casting time of 3. The only material components required are a small amount of mercury and phosphorus. The resulting rune becomes active immediately. It lasts one turn per caster level and glows faintly while it lasts. *Symbols of fear*, *hopelessness*, *pain*, or *persuasion* can be used in this manner.`,
                `When drawing a *symbol* quickly, the caster can instantly attune any number of creatures to the *symbol* rendering them immune to its effects, provided the creatures are within 60 feet of the rune when it is created and that the caster is aware of their presence.`,
                `A carefully inscribed *symbol* has a casting time of one turn. The *symbol* is inactive when finished and remains so indefinitely until triggered. Once triggered, it becomes active and glowing, usually lasting one turn per caster level. Some *symbols* can burn out more quickly. For example, a *symbol of death* ends when it has slain 80 hit points worth of creatures, or after one turn per level of the caster, whichever comes first. The material components for a carefully inscribed symbol are mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth at least 5,000 gp each.`,
                `When creating a carefully inscribed rune, the caster can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol. The caster also can attune any number or creatures to the symbol, but this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time. Attuning a small group (up to 10 creatures) takes an hour. Attuning an entire household (up to 25 creatures) takes a day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.`,
                `Known symbols include:`,
                ``,
                `***Death:*** One or more creatures within the radius, whose total hit points do not exceed 80, are irrevocably slain as though struck by the sixth-level Wizard spell *death spell*. Creatures of lowest Hit Dice or levels are slain first. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed.`,
                `***Discord:*** All creatures within the radius immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds; fighting lasts 2d4 rounds. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed on a surface.`,
                `***Fear:*** This *symbol* can be drawn quickly or carefully inscribed. Creatures within the radius are afflicted by a powerful version of the 4th-level wizard spell *fear*. If drawn quickly, this *symbol* imposes a -4 penalty to saving throws. If the rune is carefully inscribed, the saving throw penalty rises to -8.`,
                `***Hopelessness:*** This symbol can be drawn quickly or carefully inscribed. All creatures within the radius must attempt saving throws vs. spell; there is a -4 penalty if the rune is carefully inscribed. If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4 turns and submits to simple demands from foes, such as "surrender" or "get out"; the effect is similar to the third-level Wizard spell *suggestion*. If no foes are present to make demands, there is a 25% chance that a hopeless creature proves unable to take any action except standing in place. If the creature remains free to act, there is a 25% chance it retreats from the rune at normal speed. In either case, the creature can defend normally if attacked.`,
                `***Insanity:*** One or more creatures within the radius, whose combined hit points do not exceed 120, become insane and act as though affected by the fourth-level wizard spell *confusion*. Insanity lasts until a *heal*, *restoration*, or *wish* spells is used to remove the affliction. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed.`,
                `***Pain:*** Creatures within the radius suffer wracking pains that reduce Dexterity scores by two points and impose a -4 attack penalty. Both effects last 2d10 turns. This *symbol* can be drawn quickly or inscribed carefully.`,
                `***Persuasion:*** This *symbol* can be drawn quickly or inscribed carefully. All creatures within the radius must attempt saving throws vs. spell; there is a -4 penalty if the rune is carefully inscribed. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes the same alignment as the caster for 1d20 turns. During this time, affected creatures become friendly to the caster as though subjected the first-level wizard spell *charm person*.`,
                `***Sleep:*** Creatures within the radius fall into a catatonic slumber if they have 8+1 HD or fewer. (Characters are affected if they are 8th level or lower.) Sleeping creatures cannot be awakened for 1d12+4 turns. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed.`,
                `***Spell Loss:*** Any creature within the radius immediately loses 1d4 spells from memory. The DM should determine which spells are lost randomly. Creatures with no memorized spells are unaffected. Creatures who have some memorized spells, but not enough to satisfy the loss, suffer no further effects. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed.`,
                `***Stunning:*** One or more creatures within the radius, whose total hit points do not exceed 160, become stunned for 3d4 rounds, Stunned creatures drop what they are holding and cannot take any meaningful actions. They cannot communicate, employ spells, use magical items, initiate psionic abilities, use spell-like powers, fight, or move freely. Movement is limited to one-third the creature's current movement rate or a rate of 3, whichever is less. Attacks against stunned creatures gain a +4 bonus. This *symbol* must be carefully inscribed.`,
                ``,
                `A successful *dispel magic* removes the effects of a *symbol* from a creature unless the *symbol's* effect is instantaneous (*death*, *spell loss*) or the description specifies another remedy (*insanity*). The rune itself can be removed with a successful *erase* spell or by a successful *dispel magic* targeted solely on the rune.`,
                `Destruction of the surface where a *symbol* rests destroys the rune but also triggers its effects.`,
                `**Permanent Symbols:** A *symbol* can be rendered permanent with the eighth-level Wizard spell *permanency* provided it is carefully inscribed upon a permanent, non-portable surface such as a wall or door. A *permanency* spell extends a *symbol's* basic duration of one turn per caster level indefinitely. When triggered, a permanent *symbol* usually glows for about a turn, but there is no limit to how many times it can be triggered. If the *symbol* can affect only a limited number of hit points worth of creatures, the limit applies each round. For example, a permanent *symbol of death* could slay 80 hit points worth of creatures every round.`

            question: `Does the spellcraft proficiency allow a character to identify magical items? If so, can the character tell exactly what powers the items has or just whether it's magical?`,
            answer: [
                `No. The spellcraft proficiency is no substitute for a ***detect magic*** or ***identify*** spell. Spellcraft gives the character an understanding of spells and magical processes. When used to examine an item, it allows a character to identify "magical or magically endowed constructs for what they are." For purposes of the proficiency, an item must have been created wholly or extensively through magic to qualify as a magical construct. Items that have simply received enchantments or been altered through magic don't qualify. For example, a character with the spellcraft proficiency could recognize a sword created with ***Nolzur's marvelous pigments*** or a ***major creation*** spell as a magical construct. If the same character found a ***holy avenger*** sword, however, her spellcraft proficiency could help her determine that the sword was suitable for receiving an enchantment, but not whether it actually held and enchantment or what that enchantment might be.`,

A character with the cooking proficiency needn't make a proficiency check to perform such a mundane task (nor would non-proficient characters have to make any kind of dice roll). Should the party find it necessary to prepare a truly magnificent meal from the fish (perhaps to persuade the local werebear not to eat them instead), they'd need a proficient cook and a successful proficiency check.`

            question: `I'm having a hard time trying to sort out the differences between the bladesong fighting style from page 70 of the ***Complete Book of Elves*** and the bladesinger kit from page 88 of the same book. Can a bladesinger learn the bladesong style? If so, what benefits does she receive? Exactly what sort of weapon proficiencies, weapons styles, style specializations, and weapon specializations can a bladesinger learn? Can a bladesinger or character who knows the bladesong style use all the style's benefits at once? What kind of weapons can be used with the style? Can weapons that can be used one- or two-handed (bastard swords, for example) be used with the style?`,
            answer: [
                `The bladesong style from page 70 is available to any elf warrior, rogue, or priest. Non-elves, including half-elves and drow, cannot learn the style. Bladesong is essentially an unusual version of single-weapon style specialization (see the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***, page 62). The character must choose a particular type of weapon (not a class of weapons) to use with the style, and it must be a one-handed weapon. To claim any benefits from the style, the character must have one hand free. If the bladesinger holds her weapon in two hands, she loses all bladesong benefits. A character can use only one bladesong benefit (see ***CBE***, page 72) during a round but can switch between them from round to round.`,
                `Since bladesong is a style specialization, the character is free to learn other styles or weapon specializations if her class allows them. Prudent DMs will limit a weapon and style specialist to the best available specialization bonus rather then allowing them to accumulate. For example, if an elf fighter with specialization in the long sword and two slots of bladesong chooses to use the bladesong attack bonuses, she would gain a +2 attack bonus (from bladesong) and a +2 damage bonus (from weapon specialization). The lesser attack bonus of +1 from weapon specialization is ignored.`,
                `The bladesinger kit from page 88 is for elf fighter/mages who dedicate their lives to bladesong. The character is assumed to spend three weapon proficiency slots on a single weapon and the bladesong style, but she gains the benefits listed on pages 89-90 instead of the ones on page 72. The bladesinger can choose any weapon normally available to fighter/mages for bladesinging, subject to the limitations noted above. As a multi-classed character, a bladesinger cannot choose to specialize in a weapon and cannot learn any additional style specializations. (Bladesong counts as the one style specialization the character can learn; see ***CFH***, page 62.)`,
                `Note that the kit description contains a few errors. The Weapon Proficiencies section on page 88 should read: Bonus: None. *Required:* Proficiency in a one-handed weapon, bladesong style specialization (two slots). *Recommended:* None.`,
                `The Special Hindrances section on page 90 erroneously says that a bladesinger can never learn more than one weapon. This is not the case, though she suffers at least a -1 attack penalty when wielding a weapon other than their primary one; this penalty is cumulative with any nonproficiency penalty the character might suffer. Further, as a fighter a bladesinger automatically knows all four weapon styles from the ***Complete Fighter's Handbook***.`

The ***Complete Book of Elves*** says a bladesinger can attack and parry in the same round, without wasting any additional attacks. What does this mean, exactly? Characters using the bladesinger kit gain a defensive bonus when casting spells. Does the character's Dexterity score add to this bonus? The kit description also says a bladesinger can cast spells one-handed. Can spells with material components be cast this way?`,
            answer: [

According to the optional rule in chapter 9 of the ***Player's Handbook***, parrying grants a character an Armor Class bonus equal to half his level (warriors gain an extra point of bonus), but the character can attempt no other actions while parrying—so the bladesinger's parrying ability is potent indeed.

            question: `What does an ***identify*** spell reveal about a cursed item? What school of magic will a wizard's ***detect magic*** spell reveal when used on a cursed item? This issue came up in a past game. The specific items in question are ***dust of sneezing and choking*** and ***cloak of poisonousness***. The item descriptions in the ***DUNGEON MASTER® Guide*** are not very clear about this. The description in the ***DMG*** for the dust says the item appears to be either ***dust of appearance*** or ***dust of disappearance***, and the description for the ***cloak of poisonousness*** says that as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer is stricken stone dead. Two player characters fell to these items. The party used an ***identify*** spell, and the items were assumed to be beneficial. My ruling as the DM was that the ***identify*** spell revealed a false result, and the ***detect magic*** spell revealed mixed results (a possible clue that something was not right). Only a more extensive investigation on the item would reveal the existence of a curse.`,
            answer: [
                `You seem to have handled things pretty well. A ***detect magic*** spell generally indicates magic of the enchantment school or magic of whatever school the cursed item is imitating; for example, illusion/phantasm in the case of ***dust of sneezing and choking*** (because it imitates ***dust of disappearance***) or possibly divination or abjuration (if the dust seems to be ***dust of appearance***); note that the DM decides what the dust seems to be.`,
                `Generally, an ***identify*** spell should give a false indication when used on a cursed item—usually revealing a power (or magical bonus) the item merely seems to have. In the case of a ***cloak of poisonousness***, an ***identify*** spell probably indicates a powerful magical bonus of some kind. Note that many DMs require an ***identify*** caster actually to wear or use the item being probed (the spell description merely requires that the caster touch the item); anyone putting on a ***cloak of poisonousness***—even for purposes of an ***identify*** spell—is instantly slain, which makes the item's power pretty obvious. In other cases, a cursed item won't reveal itself until the user is actually under stress or in danger. For example, a wizard could examine a pair of ***boots of dancing*** without suffering any harm, perhaps falsely determining that they were ***boots of striding and springing***, and nobody would be any the wiser until some poor sap wears them into combat.`,
                `Groups who are really wary of cursed items use ***commune*** or ***contact other plane*** to confirm that their magical items are indeed beneficial before trusting them. Note that these two spells can help determine an item's exact bonuses or charges (or at least narrow down the range of possibilities).`

Do any of the following attack roll and damage modifiers apply to these "created" weapons: Strength, specialization, non-proficiency, or racial (elves & halflings)? What are their speed factors? I'm a little vague on these points, because some spell descriptions are more specific than others about which modifiers to apply.`,
            answer: [
                `Generally, bonuses, or penalties for Strength and weapon skill (racial or otherwise), don't apply to spell effects that manifest themselves as weapons. Bonuses or penalties from spells such as ***bless*** and ***prayer*** apply. As do bonuses or penalties from attack angle (rear, higher, etc.).`,
                `Spells that merely enchant normal weapons work just like other magical weapons. For example, ***shillelagh*** takes a normal cudgel (club) and makes it magical; a ***shillelagh*** wielder handles the weapon as well (or as badly) as he would handle a normal club. Beware of effects that seem to enchant weapons rather than create them; for example, ***spiritual hammer*** uses a warhammer as a material component but actually creates a hammer-shaped field of force (the warhammer being consumed in the process).`,
                `To determine speed factor, just use the speed factor of something similar to the "created" weapon. A ***spiritual hammer***, for example, has the same speed factor as a warhammer (4), a ***rainbow*** has the speed factor of a composite short bow (6), and a ***magic stone*** has the speed factor of a dart (2). If your campaign uses the optional rule that gives lower speed factors to magical weapons, any magical bonus that a created or enchanted weapon has reduces the speed factor. If the spell doesn't grant any combat bonus, speed factor is still reduced by 1; no weapon can have a speed factor of less than 1.`

The way it stands, a fighter with two short swords causes quite a bit more damage due to Strength than an equally strong guy with a two-handed sword. Not that I'm all that concerned about damage, but I'm a powerlifter, and it just doesn't sound like a guy could get more Strength into two different blows than a guy who swings a weapon with both hands. I mean, a man with two weapons gains his Strength bonus twice, where Gond the two-handed sword wielder has it only once.`,

If he puts it all into the primary weapon, the second weapon has no bonuses from Strength at all. If Gond has multiple attacks, he still enjoys whatever bonuses the player has assigned to that weapon for every attack Gond makes with that weapon.`,

Unless worn or carried, a ***necklace of missiles*** looks like a cheap medallion or bit of costume jewelry and has no pyrotechnic properties at all. A single character can activate and throw only one missile a round. I suppose one could remove a missile globe, hand off the necklace to a really dim comrade—or perhaps to a summoned creature—and then throw the missile and hope the necklace bearer fails his saving throw.

Now, the ***Faiths & Avatars*** book gives Morninglords (the specialty priests of Lathander) the ability to turn undead that are directly affected by sunlight as if four levels higher, and it states that vampires normally either avoid or seek them out. Lathander is a neutral good deity. Does this mean that a morninglord's turning abilities are useless vs. vampires?`,
            answer: [
                `Most vampires will avoid lawful good holy symbols. Some don't. (The more powerful vampires from the RAVENLOFT® setting come to mind.) Lawful good holy symbols have a smidgen of power all by themselves, enough so that any ninny can use it to ward off a typical vampire. Characters with the power to turn undead don't depend merely on their holy symbols; they channel power from their deities, which makes their alignments irrelevant. (Alignment does affect the type of influence a priest has over the undead; see next question.) The effect is similar to what might happen if a peace officer (or even someone pretending to be a peace officer) waves a badge at a fleeing suspect and shouts "stop!" The badge, as a symbol of law, might induce some people to comply with the order. If, on the other hand, the officer draws a sidearm and fires a round over the suspect's head (or into the suspects body), it tends to make a stronger impression; tangible manifestations of power can influence even the hardheaded.`,

In almost every case, however, a thief can find something that will foil even infravision (a warm spot, a dim spot, a bush, or the like). The trick lies in misdirection—getting viewers to look where the thief isn't. The stage magicians Siegfried and Roy can make a caged tiger "disappear" from a stage right in front of an audience using misdirection techniques. Note that the hide in shadows ability depends on the viewer expecting to be able to see the thief; that's why it's impossible to hide in total darkness.

            question: `The standard AD&D rules say a wizard may not use armor, period: he cannot cast spells while wearing it and gains no protection from using it. Does this mean that the best way to incapacitate a captured mage is to strap him into a suit of plate armor? If so, every mage-hunting group should stock a few spare sets of plate. A captive mage can still walk along and thus does not need to be carried or strapped to a horse, but he cannot cast any spells and is doubly humiliated by also not gaining any defensive benefit from the armor in case of an attack. If a wizards is strapped into a suit of armor, can he claim any benefit? One would think that the very nature of a suit of plate armor would turn aside some attacks. The ***PHB*** says a wizard can cast verbal-only spells when naked and tied up: does this carry over into wearing armor (for a mage, the next-best thing to being tied up), or is there some other element in armor use that interferes with magic?`,
            answer: [
                `Actually, the rules say wizards cannot use armor, but "may not" probably describes the situation better. The short answer to all these questions is that wizards in the AD&D game don't wear armor.`,

I suggest that all of the character's spells still work. The wizard should gain the full defensive benefit from the armor; though you might give opponents an attack roll bonus of +2 because the wizard is effectively off balance, and sock the wizard with a +6 initiative penalty for fighting in a foreign environment. (Armor is foreign to single-classed wizards.) Also, no single-classed wizard is going to do well when wearing a hot, heavy suit of armor, so apply any or all of the following penalties (alert readers might recognize these from a previous "Sage Advice" column):`,
                `*Encumbrance:* Even if the character in question has a Strength score high enough to carry the weight, knock his movement rate down to one half. He also should make a Dexterity check every turn or fall down and go boom. It's easy to lose one's equilibrium when one is carrying an unaccustomed weight, and a wizard might easily trip over a shield. The encumbered wizard should check Dexterity every time he tries anything that even remotely requires agility: running, jumping, using stairs (in either direction), getting on a mount, and so on.`,
                `*Fatigue:* Single-classed wizards who wear armor or carry shields should make a Constitution check every turn (more often if its very cold or very hot). Failure indicates fatigue. The character must remove the armor and rest awhile. If the weather is bad, the character must also do something to cool off or warm up. The character passes out if denied rest.`,
                `*Uncertainty:* Too much reliance on physical things undermines the mental discipline the wizard needs to command his magic. There is a 25% chance that any spell he casts during the next 24 hours will fail outright. (If the caster is wearing prohibited armor at the time of casting, the spell fails 100% of the time.) Further, the character gains no experience for the adventure in which he dons armor to protect himself. If he makes a habit of wearing armor, he might even lose a level or two. The uncertainty penalty shouldn't apply to wizards who genuinely have been forced to wear armor.`,

            question: `A few issues ago, you said that a character subjected to a poison with an immediate onset time dies by the end of the round in which he has seen poisoned. I must take extreme issue with this ruling! Describe to me how a cleric can cast a ***slow*** or ***neutralize poison*** before the character has been poisoned? Basically, you're saying that you've got to count on not missing any saves when dealing with an immediate onset time, right?`,
            answer: [
                `What? Do you want me to change my mind about what "immediate" means? Not failing any saving throws is definitely the safest bet when dealing with an opponent equipped with venom that has an immediate onset time. Unfortunately, players have no control over saving throws (in an honest game.)`,
                `Here are several ways to save a poisoned character before she goes down: When a venomous creature appears on the scene, start casting a ***neutralize*** or ***slow poison*** spell before anyone suffers a poisoned wound. This is risky, because your character will lose the spell if nobody blows a poison saving throw. Perhaps your DM will be kind and let your character hold the spell "on hands" until needed. Many DMs I know allow something called an "option" or "delay" that allows a character to withhold an action until he sees how the round is going—at the cost of going last.`,
                `Keep a magical item such as ***Keoghtom's ointment*** handy, and apply it to the poisoned character.`,
                `Have someone with the herbalism and healing proficiencies standing to treat poisoned characters without delay.`,
                `Note that if your DM applies the rules strictly, the use of spells, magical items, and complex proficiencies occupies a character for a whole round, so the rescuer cannot do anything else during a round when the poison is treated.`,

Does "magical protection" refer only to magical Armor Class adjustments?

Would hits (that would normally hit Armor Class 3) be blocked by ***stoneskin*** and also subtract from the ***invisible mail's*** duration?`,
            answer: [
                `***Invisible mail*** provides a base Armor Class of 3, period. Armor Class adjustments and defensive bonuses from any other magical source do not make the caster's Armor Class any better. Otherwise, the spell works normally with other defensive spells. For example, a wizard using both ***invisible mail*** and ***protection from evil*** cannot claim the -2 defense adjustment against evil attacks that the ***protection from evil*** spell provides, but enjoys all the spell's other benefits (saving throw bonus, hedging out enchanted creatures, and blocking mental control).`,
                `Using ***stoneskin*** with ***invisible mail*** has no effect on the ***stoneskin*** at all. Any attack on a ***stoneskin*** recipient—hit or miss—drains one charge from the ***stoneskin***.

An attack that inflicts no damage because of a ***stoneskin*** spell, however, does not count against the ***invisible mail's*** duration.`,

            question: `I've come across your discussion of the ***frisky chest*** spell from many issues ago, and I noticed a similar discussion of the abuse of the ***Tenser's floating disc*** spell in issue #241. For me, these issues beg a larger question: How does a DM draw the line between innovation and abuse? Can you name a few innovative uses of spells that should work?`,
            answer: [
                `First, trust your gut. Does the proposed use of the spell seem like abuse? If so, it probably is. If you feel enough doubt to ask "Sage Advice" for an opinion, it almost certainly is (but go ahead and ask anyway, especially if you feel you need moral support). On the other hand, if your first reaction to an unusual use of a spell is, "Wow, that's clever!" you're probably all right. In the latter case, you can always change your mind if the spell becomes a problem; as the DM it's your job, as well as your privilege, to bring things under control if they get out of hand. Here's a couple of other things to keep in mind:`,
                `*Don't be a spoilsport.* You are (or you ought to be) running your campaign for the players' enjoyment, so don't rain on their parade if you can help it. If somebody tries something cute with a spell or magical item, don't just say, "No way!" Try to think of a result that takes the adventure in an unexpected direction—one that the players hadn't bargained for—or that is at least amusing. I once had a player target a ***create water*** spell inside a blue dragon's mouth. The player confidently told me that this action would surely cause the dragon's lighting breath weapon to short out. As it happened, the dragon was an illusion and the player's attitude told me that the character in question certainly believed in it. If the dragon had been real, I probably would have decided that the breath would scatter the water in a gout of steam and spray, provided that the breath and the water appeared more or less simultaneously (which I could have determined from the initiative rolls). Perhaps, with a failed saving throw, the collision of breath and created water could have led to a whole lot a draconic coughing, gagging, and spitting. Such an event might even have rendered the dragon unable to act for a round (not unlike accidentally inhaling a beverage). As it happened, the spell had no visible effect on the illusory dragon at all; the water just fell in a big splash. The players didn't tumble to the clue and had to flee the illusory dragon. Note that ***create water*** cannot produce water inside a creature, but I think a dragon's mouth might just open wide enough so that a gout of water created within the space spanned by its jaws might not actually be inside the dragon.`,
                `*Beware when players start telling you how things work.* Before running a game, take the time to become familiar with the spells and magical items the PCs carry. That means keeping current copies of everybody's character sheets (this also helps when players forget them), including spell books and lists of priest spells. When a player tries something odd, open up your rulebook and flip to the spell or item description, study it, and decide if the action s even remotely possible. The discussion of ***Tenser's floating disc*** in issue #241 is nothing more than a step-by-step review of the parameters set forth in the spell description. About a year before writing the column for issue #241, I had a player at a convention try to use a ***floating disc*** to attack a group of tanar'ri the party had been pursuing over a series of rooftops. Before the session even started, the player had boasted that he could get some real mileage out of the spell and that I'd better be careful. So, when the player announced that his character was breaking off the chase to cast ***Tenser's floating disc***, load it with flaming oil, and send it after the tanar'ri about two blocks away, my jaw dropped. The character was three stories up, and there was a city street between the wizard and his targets. "You realize," I said, "that the disc winks out unless there's a surface no more than three feet below it, so this disc is going to wink out crossing the street and dump flaming oil all over some pedestrian or the building, or both?" Then the player's jaw dropped. As I pointed out last April, sometimes characters are smarter than their players. Because the character in question was a version of Tenser himself, I decided he knew the limitations of the spell pretty well. I didn't feel the need to point out that if the PCs, with movement rates of 12, couldn't keep up with the tanar'ri, the disc—with a movement rate of 6—wasn't going to overtake the foe, or even that tanar'ri are immune to normal fire. Sometimes player attempts at "innovation" are just plain silly.`,
                `Long-time readers of this column might recall that I have said spells do what their descriptions say they do and do nothing else. That's true, but it also means players and DMs have to read the spell descriptions and understand exactly what they do. For magical effects that don't actually produce energy or matter, that makes things pretty cut and dried—if it's not in the description, it doesn't happen. On the other hand, many spells do produce energy or matter. A ***fireball's*** fiery blast doesn't produce any concussion, but it is fire. Fire sets things alight, uses up oxygen, and produces at least some light and noise. It's a bad idea to cast a ***fireball*** in a mine or barn (both places where there could be a fair amount of flammable dust in the air). A ***fireball*** (or ***lightning bolt***) cast in cloud of grain dust might very well generate a secondary explosion that includes a massive concussion.`,
                `As for innovative spell uses that work, here are three of my personal favorites:`,
                `*Using ***pyrotechnics*** as a fire extinguisher.* My druid characters almost always pack this spell, because it can turn any fire into a big cloud of smoke and snuff out the fire to boot. This leads my DMs to place a limit on how big a fire the spell can affect. (As the spell is written, one low-level spellcaster could put out a fire of any size, say the Sun or the whole Plane of Elemental Fire.) I recommend a 10' cube per caster level.`,
                `*Using ***rope trick*** as a sky hook*. Many a time, I've had PCs in situations where a firmly affixed rope would be useful, but no good point of attachment was at hand. So cast ***rope trick***. The spell can lift a piece of rope from 5 feet to 30 feet long; long enough to haul a buddy out of a pit or swing over a chasm when there's no place to pound in a spike. Sometimes 30 feet of rope is long enough to scale a wall when a grapple might make enough noise to alert guards.`,
                `*Using ***cantrip*** as a sketchbook.* When questioning an NPC about someone's appearance, use a ***cantrip*** spell to created a two-dimensional image of the person being described. Adjust the image until it matches the unknown character's appearance just as a police artist would. Note that if the witness has a faulty memory or lively imagination, the image you get won't look anything like the unknown person, but the trick can work well. (The process can draw lots of attention, so be careful where you try it.)`

            question: `The ***Skills & Powers*** book has an optional revision to the nonweapon proficiency rules. Instead of a PC's initial rating at a proficiency being based on an ability score, it is set at a certain number. A relevant ability modifies the rating, and the rating can improve as the character expends character points while advancing levels. This is a more realistic approach, and I prefer it to the old method. The problem is that only the proficiencies listed in the ***Player's Handbook*** are covered in ***Skills & Powers***. There are dozens of proficiencies listed in other books that aren't covered. Has anyone converted these extra proficiencies to the ***Skills & Powers*** system?`,
            answer: [
                `I don't know of anyone who has taken on this task, which would be monumental considering how many proficiencies there are spread out among all the optional books (many more than mere "dozens"). If you want to use the ***Skills & Powers*** system for proficiencies not included in that book, you're on your own, but I offer these tips:`,
                `Character-point costs to learn proficiencies should range from 4 to 6 (or 2—3 CPs per "slot"). Initial ratings should range from 5 (tough) to 8 (fairly easy). Note that ***Skills & Powers*** exceeds these limits, but only rarely.`,
                `The best way to assign initial ratings and costs is to look in ***Skills & Powers*** for something similar to the proficiency in question and assign similar statistics. For example, the information gathering proficiency (from the ***Complete Thief's Handbook***) is somewhat similar to local history. Its ***Skills & Powers*** statistics might be: Cost 3; Initial Rating 7; Relevant Ability Intelligence/Knowledge, Charisma/Leadership.`

            question: `I've just finished rereading all the great information on the sahuagin in ***The Sea Devils***, but I'm disappointed that there is no information on sahuagin PCs. What would the ability score adjustments, ability limits, and class and level limits for a sahuagin character be? I would expect them to have pretty hefty Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity bonuses. What would be the chance that such a PC would have four arms?`,
            answer: [
                `***The Sea Devils*** lacks any such rules because sahuagin are the result of an ongoing eugenics experiment that ruthlessly weeds out individuality. (The vast majority of adventure-minded sea devils are fed to the sharks at an early age.)`,
                `Sahuagin PCs could be possible for an undersea campaign, but 90% of them should be malenti (sahuagin who look like sea elves); the remaining 10% should be normal, two-armed sahuagin. Among normal (not malenti) sahuagin characters, there should be, at the maximum, 1% with four arms, and many of these should be missing a limb or three from hunting or war mishaps; four-armed sahuagin lead extra tough lives, especially during youth.`,
                `All the foregoing should be determined by dice roll, because sahuagin don't get to decide much of anything by themselves.`,
                `For sahuagin ability scores, do not give any bonuses or penalties. Instead, set very narrow racial limits. I suggest the following:`,
                `Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma: minimum 11; maximum 15.`,
                `Intelligence, Wisdom: minimum 12; maximum 16.`,
                `Sahuagin are, overall, smarter and stronger than other demihumans, but only because they kill off the weaklings. In any case, it should be hard to qualify for this race.`,
                `For malenti, use the same class and level limits as half elves—but no wizards of any kind. For sahuagin, use the elf limits, but again, no wizards.`

            question: `In the ***Skills & Powers*** book, rangers can learn a skill called "sneak attack," which works just as a thief's backstab ability. If the ranger is high enough level to make multiple attacks, can he make multiple sneak attacks? What happens to the ranger's Strength bonuses? How can rangers even use this skill? After all, rangers must be good, and attacking without fair warning doesn't seem like a very "good" thing to me.`,
            answer: [
                `"Sage Advice" has covered part of this one before in regards to thieves. Once the ranger gets into position for the attack, only the first attack the character makes gains the "sneak attack" bonuses, namely a +4 attack bonus and a multiplier to weapon damage. Apply damage bonuses (from Strength, weapon skill, weapon enchantment, or any other source) after you apply the multiplier.`,
                `The ranger can choose which attack in a series of multiple attacks gets the bonuses, but any other attacks the ranger makes during round in which the sneak attack occurs are resolved normally Note that a ranger of any level could gain "multiple attacks" just by using two weapons. The same rule applies no matter how the character gains multiple attacks.`,
                `A little DM mistrust of ranger sneak attacks is a fine thing. Sticking a sword through someone's back is arguably not "good." On the other hand, sticking a sword through someone's front isn't necessarily any better. A ranger is a warrior and will find it necessary to slay foes at least once in awhile. The important thing to keep in mind is that a sneak attack ability does not give a ranger free reign to make unprovoked attacks on inoffensive creatures. A ranger should have a darn good reason to use this ability. For example, a ranger sneaking into an enemy encampment to rescue a prisoner might have cause to stab a sentry in the back on the way in or out, especially if the character can avoid having to fight off every creature in the camp by doing so. On the other hand, if the ranger comes up behind a fellow traveler on a road, he ought not to stab the poor fool in the back just because the opportunity presents itself.`,

                `No—not if you, the DM, don't want him to. (That's the "plain" part of the answer.) On the other hand, spell and magical item research is a legitimate pursuit for wizard and priest characters, provided they are of sufficient level. Players have good cause to gripe if you flatly refuse to allow them to explore this aspect of their characters. The ***High-Level Campaigns*** and ***Spells & Magic*** books contain helpful information (and rules) for creating magical items. DRAGON Magazine issue #242 (December, 1997) had an excellent article on the fine art of spell creation.`

Note that if you're using the rules for creating custom characters in the ***Skills & Powers*** book, rangers and paladins can purchase the ability to specialize in a weapon with character points.

            question: `As hard as I tried to find "Sage Advice" columns in old back issues and answer this question myself, I couldn't. Do cold-based spells with ice effects hinder undead or other creatures immune to cold? That is, while a skeleton would suffer no damage from a ***cone of cold***, would it be crushed by the stones from an ***ice storm*** or similar spell whose damage is dealt kinetically? What about a combined-effect spell, such as the 2nd-level spell ***ice knife*** from ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook***, which deals damage both through cutting and cold? For that matter, would a ***stoneskin*** spell protect a character from an ***ice storm***?`,
            answer: [
                `I appreciate your effort; however, "Sage Advice" has never dealt with this particular question. The answer depends on the spell. ***Ice storm*** delivers both impact and cold damage. A creature would have to be immune to both types of attacks to be immune; a skeleton, immune to cold, is still battered and suffers full damage. A character protected by a ***stoneskin*** spell is immune to an ***ice storm***'s impact damage but still subject to its cold. (An ***ice storm*** also drains one "charge" from the ***stoneskin***.)`,
                `An ***ice knife*** shatters on impact and inflicts only cold damage, leaving a creature such as a skeleton unharmed. Spells such as ***wall of ice*** cannot damage cold-resistant creatures unless dropped on top of them for an impact effect (though its cold still affects creatures immune to impact damage as noted under ***ice storm***, above). A stationary ***wall of ice*** provides a physical barrier against any type of creature, but cold-resistant creatures usually can break through it with no ill effect save for the delay the effort entails.`

            question: `I was reading the ***DUNGEON MASTER Guide*** and noticed that scrolls are considered 6th level or one level higher than required to cast the spell. A wizard needs to be at least 9th level to make a scroll! What gives?`,
            answer: [
                `Nothing "gives." I assume you refer to the text on scrolls in Appendix 3. You have quoted the rule correctly A spell scribed on a scroll always has a casting level (for determining level-based variables such as range, damage, duration, and resistance to dispel attempts) of one level higher than the minimum required to cast it, but never less than 6th level. The rule tends to make a scroll spell less potent when read from the scroll than it would be if the character who wrote the scroll cast it herself. (sometimes considerably less potent). In other words, the act of writing a scroll limits its power. Alert readers will notice that the caster could actually gain a casting-level boost from this rule. In such a case, assign the caster's own level to the scroll (A scroll spell never functions at a level higher than its creator's level.)`,
                `I know several DMs who allow characters to control the casting level of scrolls they write, so long as it is not less than the minimum level required to cast the spell. In most of these games, the actual casting level (not the spell level) is used to determine the failure chance when a character reads the scroll. Using unknown scrolls can be quite a gamblein such campaigns.`

            question: `How freely can a wizard with the persistent spell effect ability (from the ***Spells & Magic*** book) change the effect? For example, Andolfo pays 21 character points for a 3rd-level persistent spell and makes ***fly*** a persistent spell effect. Can he decide to change that to ***shield*** after taking the week of study? The persistent spell effect requires concentration. If something happens to break that concentration, how long does it take to start that spell effect again?`,
            answer: [
                `Once the character pays the CP cost for a particular level of spell, the character can make any spell of that level or lower persistent, provided the character can cast the spell, the DM approves, and the character gives up the required spell slot. The character can change the spell effect anytime, but it takes a week of effort to start a new persistent effect, and the old effect ends the moment the character starts working on a new one.`,
                `Once a spell has been made persistent, it is effectively permanent. The concentration requirement is misleading. The persistent spell does not end until dispelled or changed. If the character goes to sleep or loses consciousness, a persistent effect stops working, but the caster can invoke it again, just as if it were an innate ability or magical item. (I suggest an initiative modifier of +3.) Many persistent effects give no benefit unless the character concentrates on them. For example, a character with a persistent ***ESP*** or ***detect magic*** effect does not gain information from the effect unless the character actually concentrates on using the ability. Such concentration counts as the character's action for the round in which the persistent effect is used.`

For example, the caster rolls a 98 when trying to reach in area she has seen casually; a safe arrival requires a roll of 09-96 on 1d100. A 98 is two points higher than 96, resulting in an arrival 20 feet low.`

            question: `Exactly when can characters claim the benefits from a ***deck of many things***? Here's a situation that arose in my campaign: A character walks into a null magic room that copies everything that enters (something like a *mirror of opposition*). The character fights his double for awhile and is eventually forced to step out of the room to heal up. Once healed, the character returns to the room to take up the fight again. The battle eventually comes down to one roll: whoever hits the other guy first wins. The character dies, and the playing session ends. Now, one month later, the character's player argues that the character shouldn't be dead because the character had previously drawn the Fates card from a ***deck of many things***. Will this card work in a place where magic is nullified? How long can someone wait before using the card?`,
            answer: [
                `Most cards from a ***deck of many things*** take effect immediately upon drawing and simply work instantly, no matter what the circumstances. For example, cards such as the Jester, the Moon, or the Idiot inexorably work their changes on the character drawing them. In some cases, the character might be prevented from using a benefit a card has brought. For example, in a locale where all magic is suppressed, the Moon card still bestows wishes on the drawer, but the character might have to wait to use those wishes until she leaves the area. In some cases, the character gets to decide about an instant effect. For example, the Jester either grants 10,000 xp immediately or allows two extra draws. The character drawing the card must choose the effect the moment she draws the card, and the choice takes immediate effect regardless of local conditions. I would recommend that a character drawing the Fates card keep the card until she uses it. The card might be powerful enough to work even where other magic doesn't or it may not—that's up to the DM. In any case, to avoid a fate, the player must say when the character uses the card and must say so promptly. The card allows the drawer to avoid a fate, not reverse a fate. So the card must be used more or less as the fate happens. The DM should not subject the player to any sort of countdown, but trying to use the card a day or a month after doesn't do any good.`

If so, can the character then close the book and repeat the procedure the next day? The book disappears when the last page is turned. But what if the owner closes it before reaching the last page and starts again? I assume it is impossible to "cheat" the usefulness of this book by putting tabs on the pages. Is it possible for two characters to create a ***book of infinite spells*** together, placing their most potent spells in it?`,
            answer: [
                `The owner can turn as many pages as he likes but can cast only one spell a day from the book; the spell always must be from the page to which the book is opened at the time of casting. Spells on pages that already have been turned are lost. Once turned, the pages either go blank or disappear from the book, as the DM desires.`,
                `If the book is closed, then opened again, I suggest that the book either opens to the page where it was previously opened, or to the next page (which means that closing the book "turns" the page).`,

            question: `What does the gas breath weapon of a green or gold dragon count as? Is it poisonous or something else? Does the immunity to gas include poison gas and corrosive gases?

A ***scarab of protection*** allows anyone at least a slight chance of making a successful saving throw against the spell. Effects that shield the recipient's mind from attack can be effective.

            answer: [

If cast on an area, any spell or spell-like effect within that area is subject to dispelling. Attempts at spell casting are disrupted with the ***dispel magic's*** area of effect as well. Magical items and spell effects made permanent with the ***permanency*** spell are not subject to area dispels.

            question: `Say a character casts ***magic jar***, enters the body of someone else, then destroys both her original body and the receptacle that holds the life force of the host body. Would the host body effectively be the caster's body? If the caster (in the host body) was killed, and a ***resurrection*** or ***raise dead*** attempt were made on the body, would the caster come back to the host body? If not, is there any way that the wizard can ever permanently claim the body as her own, so that magic could return her life force to the body in question?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***magic jar*** spell allows a character to transfer her life force from her own body to the receptacle used in the spell, then from the receptacle to another body. If a host body is slain while a ***magic jar*** caster occupies it, the caster's life force must return to the receptacle. The caster dies along with the host body if the receptacle has been destroyed, is out of range, or is unavailable for any other reason. It makes no difference what happened to the caster's original body because, without the receptacle, the caster's life force cannot move to another body. Not even an ***amulet of life protection*** can save the caster's life.`,

If the original life force has been irrevocably slain (perhaps by being within a ***magic jar*** receptacle when it was destroyed), the attempt to bring the body back to life fails.`,
                `It might be possible to lay permanent claim to a host body. A carefully worded ***wish*** might do the trick, though using a ***wish*** for this sort of bodysnatching is most unfair (almost as unfair as ***wishing*** the original occupant were dead). Such a ***wish*** exposes the user to whatever adverse consequences the DM can dream up. It certainly is possible to research a spell that allows permanent transfers of life force or to create a magical item to do so. Both of these options are likely to be difficult and dangerous to create and even more perilous to use. Powerful spellcasting characters are best advised to use ***clone*** spells, ***potions of longevity***, and the like to keep themselves healthy rather than looking for new bodies to steal.`,

Are there any special restrictions that apply to the character when occupying a host?`,
            answer: [
                `The side effects from casting a difficult spell represent damage to a character's whole being, not just his body. Such penalties stick with him wherever he goes, even when they seem purely physical. For example, if a character "borrows" a body and then casts a ***permanency*** spell, he'll find that any body he occupies suffers the Constitution loss.`,

Even fairly routine activities, such as eating or getting dressed, might take a little longer. Complex activities, such as spellcasting, might require a Dexterity or Wisdom check (or both) at a substantial penalty.`,
                `If the host body is significantly different (say a human occupying a centaur's body). The character might suffer a movement penalty and be unable to perform any complex task. In a short time, such a character might become incapacitated thanks to the cumulative effects of too many minor accidents, improper diet, insufficient rest, and a host of other problems. In any case, the character must spend some time (and maybe even a proficiency slot), learning how to use and take proper care of the host.`,
                `No matter what type of host body the caster invades, he'll have to be wary of spells such as ***dispel magic*** and ***dispel evil***, which can drive him from the host body.

Third, how does the staff work when the opponent can be hit only by magical weapons? What happens to the staff's ability to hit these types of opponents when it's taken into the planes?

            answer: [
                `Possibly, but probably not. An explosion occurs only where the two spell effects overlap—not throughout both areas of effect. For example, if a character using a ***detect magic*** spell was 40 feet away from a ghul lord who had used a manipulation to create a ***protection from good*** effect, only the ghul lord would be caught in the resulting explosion, because the ***protection from good*** spell's area of effect (a 3'-radius around the caster) isn't big enough to include the other character.`

            question: `What is the effect of *blindness*, *deafness*, or *invisibility* on chances to surprise and be surprised, initiative, attack rolls, Armor Class, saving throws, movement rate, and spell failure?`,
            answer: [
                `You can get most of this information from Tables 57 and 72 in the ***DMG***.`,
                `Table 57 gives surprise modifiers. If a character is deaf, all foes are effectively silenced (-2 surprise modifier for the deafened character). *Invisibility* has its own line on the table.`,
                `Table 72 gives movement and combat modifiers for darkness. Characters who are blind function exactly as if operating in total darkness.`,
                `*Invisibility* has a similar effect to total darkness. Attacks against invisible characters suffer a -4 penalty. Some DMs I know also penalize the defender's AC by 4 when attacked by an invisible opponent, but that's strictly a house rule.`,
                `Spellcasters must see their targets to cast spells, so *blindness* pretty much shuts down a spellcaster. Though the rules on spellcasting (see the Notes on Spells section in Appendix 2 of the ***PH***) don't say so, I recommend excluding spells with a range of "touch" or "0" from the see-the-target requirement. In the case of a touch spell, the caster must still make an attack roll at a -4 penalty to touch an opponent he cannot see.`,
                `Invisible creatures are effectively immune to spells that must be targeted on them. Note that it's certainly possible to catch an invisible creature in a spell effect that fills an entire area—if the caster can see the spell's target point, he does not need to see anything else. Many DMs allow spellcasters to target invisible creatures when the characters know the creature's approximate location but cannot actually see it. For example, if an invisible creature leaves visible footprints, a character might surmise the creature's location and fire off a spell. In such a case, the invisible creature should receive a +4 saving throw bonus.`,
                `Deafness of any kind causes any spell with a verbal component to fail at least 20% of the time. Some forms of magical deafness, such as ***holy word***, impose a higher spell failure chance.`

For example, the reverse of ***detect lie*** has a longer duration than the standard spell does. My question is about ***slay living***; elves cannot be raised with a ***raise dead*** spell. Since there is no further text discussing those that are affected, are elves immune to ***slay living***? I feel that they should be. Unlike ***detect lie***, there is no further text that states a different area of effect, range, duration, or creatures affected.

My friend has a scar on the palm of his right hand, which he got from catching an arrow through his hand. Now, even he admits that he missed the arrow more times then he caught it, and he was not the only person he knows who has a similar scar somewhere on the body, but the simple fact exists that it is possible to catch an arrow. Simply telling that guy, "No, juggling doesn't allow a character to catch arrows," gives him no assistance in DMing or playing. Considering the amount of weight that your rulings have with many DMs and players, you have killed a lot of daring arrow-catching attempts, with their equally spectacular failures.`,
            answer: [
                `You are correct; I have not met your friend. In fact, I have never met anyone who has made a hobby of trying to catch arrows, though several individuals of my acquaintance are probably foolish enough to try it, given suitable encouragement. Let's hope you and they never meet.`,
                `I'll point out here that the column in issue #248 said nothing at all about arrow catching in general, just arrow catching with regard to the the fairly common Juggling proficiency. Just a reminder: arrow catching is not a function of the Juggling proficiency.) Rest assured that I am very much aware how influential this column can be, hence my haste to squash the notion that for a measly one-slot proficiency (two slots for non-Thieves) PCs can run around snatching arrows out of the air like actors in a bad martial arts flick. As for any chilling effect issue #248's column had on arrow-catching in the AD&D game, you can also rest assured that "Sage Advice" has hardly ever prevented player characters from taking harebrained risks. Such ideas have an irresistible momentum that not even this column can bring to a halt.`,
                `In any case, if any DM wants to create a Catch Arrow skill, that's okay by me; I suggest making the skill's function inversely proportional to the character's Wisdom score.`,
                `Should a PC ever really need to catch an arrow, it's ok to allow a one-shot attempt (really). Judging from your description of your friend's scars, I'd venture to suggest that this would not so much involve catching the arrow (in the same sense as catching a baseball) as deciding exactly where the arrow will hit—sort of a reversed called shot. Since the "catcher" is putting herself in harm's way, l'd have that character attempt saving throw vs. breath weapon, adjusted for Dexterity. (It's fine to give jugglers a bonus to the this saving throw. If the save fails, the character is hit by the arrow, no matter what the attack roll was. (That's the penalty for stepping into harm's way.) If the saving throw succeeds, the character takes the arrow through the hand or other appendage), provided the attack roll was good enough to hit the character. If the attack roll missed and the saving throw succeeds, the character catches the arrow, ta da!`

            question: `My group has been having a discussion over whether the use of poison is an evil act. The situation is that a Chaotic Good Thief has gotten his hands on a vial of Type E poison and wants to use it. The majority of the group believes that the situation in which the poison is used is what determines good or evil. If we are fighting a fire drake, then using poison against the drake is OK. However, if the Thief uses poison against Joe Blow the Fighter, then this could be an evil act depending on Joe's alignment. As for myself, I think the situation is the determining factor, but I also think good characters should use poison only as a last resort. The DM of this group is unsure but basically believes the use of any poison is an evil act. I know the DM is always right, but can you give your two cents' worth?`,
            answer: [
                `Your DM is right to look askance at characters who use poison—not because poison is inherently evil (poison has no alignment at all) but because poison's ability to deliver quick death can get out of hand in a real hurry. As for my "two cents' worth," take a look at the biographical note at the end of this column in issue #247. The note relates the story of how one of my characters, a Lawful Good Ranger, happened to use poison once. In this case, the Ranger was trying to scrub some contact poison of an ***ioun stone*** when a dragon attacked him. In a fit of pique, the Ranger tossed the poisoned stone down the dragon's gullet and killed it. No one present (and the group included D&D® co-creator E. Gary Gygax) thought that was an evil act.`,
                `On the other hand, the Ranger really didn't plan to use the poison as a weapon; it just happened that way. Combat in the AD&D game generally—at least for Warriors—follows the chivalric ideal. Opponents look each other in the eye (conditions permitting) as they face of and strive to outmaneuver (or outlast one another in a true measure of fighting prowess. Poison, which can make even a minor cut deadly, makes the affair decidedly less heroic. Since the PC in question is a Thief, the character probably isn't pushing the envelope too much by carrying around some discovered poison. For someone like a Paladin, however, destroying the stuff pronto would be the honorable and responsible thing to do; doing so means the Paladin will not be tempted to use it improperly, and there's no chance that the stuff will be lost or stolen and subsequently used against some innocent.`,
                `In any case (Paladin or Thief), if the poison-packing character's conduct is otherwise impeccable and the poison is used against a dangerous foe that must be defeated quickly for some reason (to keep the fire drake in your example from leveling a whole village, for instance), the character ought to get away with it. A dead monster is a dead monster, whether the PCs chopped it up with swords or killed it with poison.`,

            question: `I have an elf Ranger character with the Archer kit from ***The Complete Book of Elves***. The book says the character can fire two arrows at once from the bow. He can do this with a -1 initiative penalty and a -1 attack penalty. My character is also specialized with the longbow. The ***Player's Handbook*** says a character specialized with the bow can walk around with an arrow nocked and can simply draw and fire before initiative is rolled: a shoot-first, ask-questions-later, pre-initiative advantage. Could the specialized elven Archer fire two nocked arrows before initiative is rolled? One book says it's done with a -1 initiative penalty, and the other says there is no initiative roll. I understand that the character would still fire with a -1 attack penalty, but I am curious about the pre-initiative dual shot.`,
            answer: [
                `Actually, the ***Player's Handbook*** says nothing about "walking around" with an arrow ready to fire. It says a bow specialist can fire before any initiative rolls if he starts out with an arrow nocked and drawn and with the foe in sight. (See the Effects of Specialization section in Chapter 5). It's pretty hard to walk around with a bow pulled back, and even if the character could manage the feat without accidentally shooting his pals in the back several times a day, he still doesn't get of a shot before the initiative roll unless he can see the target before the initiative roll.`,
                `I suggest following this particular rule to the letter: One arrow fired before initiative, and then only if the archer meets all the requirements. As "Sage Advice" has pointed out before (in issue #255), characters can use only one fancy bow trick at a time.`

If the Fighter is armed with only one weapon, he makes one attack during the phase when the action occurs. For example, if he charges in the fast phase and his charge movement brings an opponent within reach, he attacks once in the fast phase and cannot attack again until the average phase. Note that the armor class penalty for charging applies for the whole round. If the Fighter uses two weapons, he can use both during the same phase, and the attack bonus from the charge applies to both attacks. Remember that a second weapon gives a character only one extra attack each round, so once the character uses the second weapon, he can't use it again on a later phase of the same round.`

He must say, "I cast ***dispel magic*** centered on a point 30 feet directly northeast of me." The spell still fails if there is a solid object (such as the bedroom wall) between the Wizard and the front door. The Wizard could not use ***magic missile*** or ***charm person*** this way, because these spells must be targeted on creatures.

Nevertheless, it's perfectly reasonable—and actually highly desirable—to exact a price for special abilities gained through a ***wish*** (or for any other benefit a ***wish*** grants).

It's possible you let the player of too lightly. The hindrances should work nicely if your campaign features lots of above-ground adventures, especially in an urban setting.

After 1st level, the character can devote additional weapon proficiency slots to the style and gain the additional benefits noted on page 78 (under the Continuing Specialization heading).

Of course, once the character has tasted enough to detect the poison, the character has also probably been poisoned. If the character very carefully tastes poisoned food and is equally careful not the swallow any, it might be reasonable to allow a proficiency check to note the poison; many poisons have very, little taste and should impose a penalty to the check. Sticking an ingested poison in one's mouth is dangerous, so require the character to make a saving throw vs. poison, but at a bonus, say +4.

<br>
**Rune of Power**<br>
(Abjuration, Evocation)<br>
Level: 5<br>
Sphere: guardian, Wards<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S, M<br>
Duration: Until discharged<br>
Casting Time: 1 round per square foot<br>
Area of Effect: See text<br>
Saving Throw: See text<br>`,
                `This special type of magical inscription was once the heart of all dwarven magic, usable by all dwarves with differing degrees of power and reliability. Modern dwarves do not have this power. Certain dwarven Priests (see ***Demihuman Deities***) can cast these runes as spells.`,
                `A *rune of power* is similar to a *glyph of warding* spell. A rune can be drawn to any size larger than the caster's hand and can be extended to encompass any size area provided the rune remains on a single, contiguous surface. Successful *dispel magic* or *erase* spells will remove *runes of power*. Thieves can locate and disable *runes of power* as magical traps.`,
                `Any being touching the *rune*, touching or opening the surface upon which the *rune* is inscribed, or passing though an opening bounded by the *rune* on four sides suffers its harmful effects. *Runes* cannot function offensively; for example, a *rune* placed on a sword is not triggered if the sword is used to strike an enemy. If, however, someone picks up a sword protected by a *rune*, the *rune* is triggered.`,
                `The Priest casting the *rune* can specify a password or set of conditions that keep the *rune* from discharging.`,
                `A *rune of power* can be set to avoid discharging when creatures of certain races, alignments, faiths, and sizes try to pass it. It cannot be set to avoid specific levels, hit dice, or classes of creatures.`,
                `A *rune of power* cannot be placed in the same area with another *rune*, a *glyph of warding*, or a *symbol*. The second warding spell placed in such an area fails.`,
                `The most widely known *runes of power* are:`,
                `***Alhalbrin:*** This *rune* melts metal. Once triggered, it glows for 3 rounds. All metal within 30 feet of the glowing *rune* becomes hot, inflicting 1d4 points of damage each round upon any creature wearing or touching it. Each metal item must make a successful saving throw vs. magical fire at a-3 penalty each round it is affected or melt. Melting metal inflicts 4d6 points of damage on any creature touching or wearing it.`,
                `***Faerindyl:*** This *rune* causes a 10'-diameter sphere of flame to shoot from the protected surface and roll over the creature who triggered it. The sphere travels in a straight line at a movement rate of 18 for 1 turn. If the sphere collides with an object larger than it is, it bursts, filling a 20'-radius area with flame. (It always bursts when its duration expires.) The sphere simply rolls over smaller objects. If an object is too large to roll over and too small to burst the sphere, the sphere rolls around it (50% chance to go left or right). The sphere must roll along a surface. If it rolls over an opening in the floor, it falls and bursts if the drop is more than 10 feet. It can roll up or down stairs or ramps.`,
                `Objects the sphere touches must make a saving throw vs. magical fire; creatures the sphere touches suffer 3d6 points of fire damage (no saving throw). When the sphere bursts, all creatures within the 20'-radius area suffer 3d6 points of fire damage (save vs. spell for half).`,
                `***Sabras:*** This *rune* creates an effect similar to a *blade barrier* 10 feet thick and as long and wide as the surface the *rune* protects (or the opening the *rune* surrounds). The barrier lasts one round but inflicts 4d6 points of damage to creatures within the area (save vs. spell for half). A Priest must be at least 13th level to cast this *rune*.`,
                `***Thundaril:*** This *rune* acts as a *polymorph other* spell on all creatures within a 20'-radius area (save vs. spell to negate). The caster must choose a tiny, innocuous form for affected creatures to assume. Snails, slugs, and toads seem to be the favorites. A Priest must be at least 9th level to cast this *rune*.`,
                `***Velurndyn:*** This *rune* acts as a reverse *gravity* spell. When triggered, it flings all beings within 20 feet upward as high as 30 feet, before releasing them to fall to the ground. Creatures unable to fly suffer normal falling damage. Some old dwarven fortresses feature spiked ceilings that make this *rune* even more deadly. A Priest must be at least 15th level to cast this *rune*.`,
                `Some *runes of power* can be scribed in the air or on a surface the caster can touch. These have a casting time of 1 round and take immediate effect when completed.`,
                `The most widely known of these runes are:`,
                `***Bhelaerak:*** Acts as the 8th-level Wizard spell *glassteel*, affecting ten pounds of material per level of the Priest.`,
                `***Corsimmyr:*** Acts as the 5th-level Wizard spell *passwall*. A Priest must be at least 11th level to cast this *rune*.`,
                `***Delhaubrin:*** Acts as the 2nd-level Wizard spell *shatter*.`,
                `***Elemsyr:*** Acts as the 2nd-level Wizard spell *invisibility*, affecting a single creature of any size or object up to human size.`,
                `The material component to create any *rune of power* is the Priest's holy symbol, which is used to trace the *rune*.`,

When my group tackled this problem, our first thought was that casting the 1st-level spell ***protection from hunger and thirst*** (originally from ***The Complete Wizard's Handbook***) would be a good start. The ***Wizard's Spell Compendium, Volume Three*** now lists this spell as lost knowledge, however, and the spell has been rewritten as a 7th-level spell. This leaves a low-level sha'ir with only two spells that can help him survive a ritual. One is the 1st-level spell ***cool strength***, which protects against dehydration for 12 hours per level. The other is the 1st-level spell ***ritual strength***, which lasts only 1 hour per level. This does not help when the minimum ritual length given in ***The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook*** is 12 hours.`,

                `It's tough for sha'irs to survive any ritual.

At best, ***protection from hunger and thirst*** negates the penalties to Constitution checks the sha'ir makes during the ritual.`,
                `I suggest that you don't count any time spent under a ***ritual strength*** spell as "elapsed time" for purposes of calculating when the sha'ir must make a Constitution check during the ritual nor when assessing penalties to those checks. For example, a 5th-level sha'ir uses a ***ritual strength*** spell to perform the increased damage ritual (16 hours). The character starts making checks after hour 13 (instead of hour 8) and doesn't suffer a check penalty until hour 15.`

A ***dimension door*** mishap on the Inner Planes probably strands the caster on the Astral Plane. There's nothing "special" about the Inner Planes; they're just not "adjacent" to the Astral.

No matter what the PCs' Charisma scores are, they probably won't succeed unless at least one of them has a decent entertainment proficiency (Singing, Dancing, Tumbling, or the like).

            question: `If a target has both cover and concealment, how is the modifier calculated? For example, a bandit is standing halfway behind a tree (50% cover, or 4 to Armor Class), and the surrounding undergrowth provides 25% concealment (-1 to Armor Class). What is the resulting modifier? Technically, you can't just add them together, because concealment is more effective when there is less to conceal.`,

In this case, you could assume the character is 75% concealed (50% hard cover implies 50% concealment, plus the additional 25% from the undergrowth).

            question: `According to the ***Demihuman Deities*** book, specialty priests (xothor) of Dugmaren Brightmantle can use all magical items? All? Is this an acknowledged error for which there is errata? If not, there should be some logical restrictions. Dugmaren Brightmantle is an appropriate god to allow his dedicated followers to use many magical items, but "all" seems to be pushing it. For example, xothor should not be able to use magical platemail, since their armor restriction precludes wearing armor heavier than chain. What about items that work best for one particular class? For example, anyone can use a ***wand of magic missiles***, but a wizard can get more oomph from it than anyone else.`,
            answer: [
                `No error: Xothor must obey the armor and weapon restrictions set forth in their priesthood entry. Otherwise, they can pick up and use most magical items just as though they were of the "correct" class and race to use them. Note the special rules about scroll use in the description of the priesthood.`,

Likewise, a xothar cannot benefit from a ***manual of stealthy pilfering*** or a ***libram of silver magic***.`,

I recommend that the character make the switch right after gaining a new fighter level. The character should then observe all the paladin restrictions and be required to earn enough experience to reach the next paladin level.`,

In the meantime, the character must give up weapon specialization, tithe, and otherwise act as a paladin—before gaining any of the paladin's benefits. If the character performs exceptionally well, the DM might want to award some paladin benefits a little at a time, say every 10,000 XP or so.

Be sure to check the specialty priest description for specific exceptions.`

This cancellation occurs only in places where both spells are operating. The other five ***continual light*** effects keep working.

            question: `The ***Combat & Tactics*** rules say swooping creatures are subject to attacks of opportunity. Say an abishai happened to swoop a fighter with multiple attacks. Can the fighter make all his or her attacks against the abishai? Can the fighter make all these attacks, plus an extra attack of opportunity, as the abishai swoops by? Is there any away the swooping abishai can avoid the fighter's attacks?`,
            answer: [
                `The number of attacks the fighter can make against the abishai depends on the order of actions in the round—and on exactly what the abishai does.`,
                `Let's pause for a few reminders: Creatures gain one attack during an attack of opportunity. Creatures have their normal attacks during their turns in the order of phases in the round, and any actions that happen in the same phase are resolved in initiative order. A character who attacks multiple times with the same weapon takes the first attack on the base phase or the weapon's phase, whichever is slower. The additional attacks come once per phase afterward`,
                `The fighter in your example can get both attacks against the abishai only if the abishai happens to be in a square the character threatens during both phases in which the character is entitled to attack. Since the abishai is swooping, that's not likely to happen.`,
                `The abishai can avoid attacks of opportunity in two ways. The best way is to swoop in and attack the fighter from a square the character does not threaten. The abishai can then deliver its attacks and fly away. It the abishai does not pass through the area the fighter threatens on the way in or on the way out, it does not suffer an attack of opportunity. Note, however, that the fighter can adjust facing once each round—and might turn around to threaten the abishai when it arrives`,
                `The other way the abishai can avoid an attack of opportunity from the fighter is to stop moving after it attacks. Even if the fighter turns to face the abishai, there will be no attack of opportunity because the abishai does not leave the zone the fighter threatens. The next round, the abishai can simply withdraw and leave the threatened zone without an attack of opportunity. If the abishai's base phase comes before the fighter has his or her first attack, the fighter can't do anything about it. If the fighter's attack comes before the abishai's move, the fighter can make the attack, and there's nothing the abishai can do about it.`

            question: `There's a huge debate raging on the TSR Internet message boards (some 40 posts in all) over the ***wall of force*** spell, mostly regarding how ***wall of force*** affects other spells. How solid is a ***wall of force***? Would running into it be like hitting a solid stone wall? If a spell's physical manifestation contacts the ***wall of force*** (lets say it's ***Melf's acid arrow***), does it pass through the wall, or is it stopped? If an area of effect spell's physical manifestation is very large, say a ***fireball***, would the blast be large enough to arc over the top and hit creatures standing on the other side? If a spell has no physical manifestation, say ***feeblemind***, and it is cast at a target on the other side of the ***wall of force***, would the wall stop the spell from affecting the target? If a spell has a physical manifestation, but can start at a point chosen by the caster, not from the caster's own body, say a ***lightning bolt***, and the caster attempts to start the physical manifestation on the other side of the ***wall of force*** so that it would hit a creature standing on that side, would the creature be hit by the spell?`,
            answer: [
                `A ***wall of force*** is an absolutely impregnable and immobile physical barrier that cannot be chipped, cut, or shifted. That makes a pretty good argument for making it unpleasant to run into. On the other hand, it's magical and has no mass to speak of, so perhaps hitting it at a run would just stop the running creature. Individual DMs have considerable wiggle room here.`,
                `In the AD&D game, physical barriers stop spells. Not only will a spell's area of effect not extend past a physical barrier, but there must also be an unbroken line between the caster and the spell's target or target point (the point where the area of effect originates). Imagine a string stretched taut between the spellcaster and the target or target point. If any obstacle prevents that string from being absolutely straight, the spell is blocked. Some spells, such as ***Melf's acid arrow***, create an effect that begins at the caster and follows a straight path to the target; such effects hit a ***wall of force*** and go "splat," usually harmlessly. Other effects manifest themselves at the target or target point. These simply fail if a ***wall of force*** blocks the line between caster and target—the caster cannot circumvent the ***wall of force*** by choosing a target or target point beyond the wall.`,
                `There are certain spells that ignore barriers, such as ***clairaudience*** and ***teleport***; these ignore ***walls of force***. There are other effects that simply rely on vision. Gaze attacks, for example. If you see a medusa's face, you might turn to stone, and a barrier between you and a medusa cannot save you if it is transparent, no matter how strong it is. (Note that rays from beholders' or retrievers' eyes are not gaze attacks, and ***walls of force*** stop them.)`,
                `Certain divination effects, such as ***true seeing***, also remain unaffected by a ***wall of force*** because it is transparent. The overwhelming majority of spells and magical effects stop cold when they hit a ***wall of force***.`,
                `The missile from a ***fireball*** spell detonates if it strikes a ***wall of force***. Note that a ***fireball*** reshapes itself to fill a constant volume of about 33,000 cubic feet. If the ***wall of force*** is 25 feet square or larger, or if the ***wall of force*** has been placed to seal off an area entirely, the whole blast expands back toward the caster. If the ***wall of force*** is less than 25 feet square and there is space around its edges, the ***fireball*** seeps though, and the ***fireball's*** volume will be more or less equally distributed on both sides of the ***wall***. Creatures behind the ***wall*** (that is, on the side opposite the spellcaster) gain saving throw bonuses.`

            question: `A ***sword of life stealing*** drains one level or Hit Die from the opponent on a natural 20. Does this include the +2 bonus of the ***sword***? For example, if you rolled an 18, can you add the +2 bonus to drain a level? Also, the ***sword*** is supposed to give the wielder hit points from the opponent. Do you gain hit points only when you roll a natural 20, or whenever a successful hit occurs? How many hit points do you gain?`,
            answer: [
                `Whenever something requires a "natural 20," the number showing on the die must actually be a 20, not some lower roll modified to a 20. In the case of a special weapon power such as this, the attack also must hit.`,
                `A ***sword of life stealing*** grants its wielder hit points only when the sword drains a level from an opponent. The wielder gains exactly as many hit points as the opponent loses to the level drain.

The wizard suffers the damage a ***sword +2*** normally inflicts (1d8 +2 plus any additional damage bonuses the wielder might have from Strength or weapon skill). The wizard also becomes 8th-level and loses a 4-sided Hit Die. If the lost Hit Die is worth 3 hit points, then 3 hit points is what the sword wielder gains. The amount of damage the opponent suffers from the blow is irrelevant; only the hit points lost to the level drain count. Note that hit points from the sword can never give the wielder more than maximum hit points. If the wielder in our example already was at maximum hit points, he or she would gain nothing.`

            question: `I'm confused about the gem values required for some wizard spells. For example the ***lesser sign of sealing*** spell requires a pinch of gem dust worth at least 100 gp—a sapphire for electricity. A sapphire, however, has a base value of 1,000 gp. I know gems of lesser value are possible, but these are pretty rare, and a gem of only a tenth the base value is extremely rare. Then there are the gems needed for the ***conjure elemental-kin*** spell, which requires an aquamarine, amber, ruby, or emerald worth 1,500 gp. Ambers are commonly worth only 100 gp, and aquamarines are typically only 500 gp. It would be difficult to find a 1,500-gp aquamarine and even harder to discover a 1,500 gp amber. Since the spell description says you need a gem worth 1,500 gp (instead of 1,500 gp worth of gems), it seems this spell cannot be used with ambers or aquamarines very often.`,
            answer: [
                `Read the material component entry carefully. If it calls for a single gem, that is what you must have. If it calls for a certain monetary value of gems, you can combine smaller stones to achieve the necessary amount. For example, the ***lesser sign of sealing*** spell requires 100 gp worth of gem dust, not a single gem.`,
                `If a spell requires a single gem of a certain value, you can cut large gems into smaller, less valuable pieces (or just use a gem that is bigger than you need), but you can't combine smaller gems to get the required amount. For example, you can cut a 1,000-gp stone into ten 100-gp pieces (or perhaps only eight or nine 100-gp pieces if the DM wants to allow for wastage and jeweler's fees) for use in spells that require 100-gp gems.

            question: `In the original AD&D game, the casting time for the ***feather fall*** spell was ⅒ of a segment, or about .6 seconds. Without getting too far into the math, this means that a wizard has to fall no more than 10 feet before getting the spell of (given that casting cannot begin until the wizard falls). The current rules give the casting time as 1, implying a casting time of 1 segment, or 6 seconds. Given that a wizard will typically fall over 500 feet in that time, it seems that the usefulness of the spell is now sorely limited. Though I am inclined to view the implications of this change as mere oversight, I know a physics teacher who disagrees and insists that ***feather fall*** should be useless at heights less than 600 feet (except as an attack against airborne creatures). The question is, therefore, how long should it take to cast the spell?`,
            answer: [
                `It takes one action to cast a ***feather fall*** spell. Exactly how long that action takes is hard to estimate, but it lies somewhere between the amount of time it would take to say "BOO!" and one minute. Since the spell description says the spell takes effect instantly, I imagine the actual time required is mush closer to the "Boo!" end of the spectrum.`,
                `In any case, the current game does not use segments, and you should not assume that a spell with a casting time of 1 takes 6 seconds to cast; even the 1-minute length of a melee round is an arbitrary value used strictly for convenience.

            question: `Delvesonns (dwarf specialty priests of Dumathoin from the ***Demihuman Deities*** book) can use the ***identify*** spell at will; however, their description says nothing about the loss of Constitution casting an ***identify*** spell usually imposes. If delvesonns do suffer the Constitution loss, that would seem to severely limit the ability to cast ***identify*** at will. We found an example in the ***Faiths & Avatars*** book that does not lose Constitution (specialty priests of Azuth), but in that case the description specifically says that their ***identify*** power does not cause Constitution loss. So, do delvesonns lose Constitution when they use their ***identify*** ability?`,

            question: `I'm a DM, and I'm disputing something with one of my players who is also a DM. Our disagreement surrounds the turning undead ability. After a successful turning roll, you roll 2d6. Is this roll for the total number of Hit Dice turned or the number of creatures turned? Do you roll the 2d6 once for the whole turning attempt, or once for each type of undead creature present? If not, how do you handle mixed groups of undead? What happens when some of the undead are turned or destroyed automatically? What happens when you have a mixed group of undead and some of them are weak enough that an extra 2d4 creatures are affected?`,
            answer: [
                `First, in your campaign, you make the call, no matter how your players choose to do things when they run their own campaigns.`,
                `You roll your 2d6 only once per encounter (because each priest or paladin can only make one turning attempt during each encounter), and then only if the initial 1d20 roll is high enough to succeed. If there is a mixed group of undead, the weakest undead are affected first. Among undead of the same Hit Dice, the undead closest to the caster are affected first. Note that it is possible to affect some undead in a mixed group and not others. For example, a 6th-level cleric encounters six shadows and two wraiths, all moving single file down a corridor toward the cleric. One wraith is in the lead, followed by the six shadows, with the second wraith bringing up the rear. The cleric rolls 1d20 and gets a 10, which is high enough to affect the shadows but not the wraiths. The cleric rolls 2d6 and gets a 5. Neither wraith is affected because the turning roll was not high enough. The five shadows closest to the cleric are turned, leaving the last shadow unaffected. On the following round, another 6th-level cleric steps up and tries a turning roll. He gets a 20, but the 2d6 roll is only a 2. The remaining shadow is turned (because the weakest creatures are affected first). The wraith closest to the cleric is also turned, leaving the second wraith unaffected.`,
                `A mixed group of undead that contains creatures the priest or paladin can turn or destroy automatically is handled in the same way, except that some creatures will be affected no matter what the initial 1d20 roll is. Apply any automatic turning or destruction before determining if any other creatures are affected. If the priest or paladin can destroy extra creatures, roll 2d4 first and destroy all those creatures first. For example a 13th-level cleric encounters 2 spectres, 6 wraiths, and 8 shadows. The cleric automatically destroys the shadows (blasting an extra 2d4 of them), automatically turns the wraiths, and needs a turning roll of 4 to turn the spectres. The cleric rolls 1d20 and gets a 1. The cleric still can affect 2d6 of the wraiths and shadows, and destroys an extra 2d4 shadows to boot. The cleric rolls 2d4 first; the cleric rolls a 5 and destroys five shadows. Now the cleric rolls 2d6 and gets a 7; this destroys the remaining shadow and turns all 6 wraiths.`

            question: `The material in the ***Skills & Powers*** book on multi-class characters has me confused.

            question: `It occurred to me that some crossbows might be more durable than long or short bows in melee combat (as a last resort, of course). Can crossbows be reliably used as melee weapons? I would like to know, because it seems to me that such use, when combined with some of the characteristics the ***Combat & Tactics*** book gives crossbows, would make them formidable competitors with the longbow/shortbow family, especially if a fighting style specialization was added for wielding bows, crossbows, and elven bows as melee weapons when missile combat is not an option.`,
            answer: [
                `In general, missile hurling devices do not make efficient melee weapons, though whacking a dragon across the snout with a longbow or heavy crossbow is almost certain to get the creature's attention.`,
                `I some desperate character actually tries this, just treat it as a nonlethal attack. In the core AD&D® game, the character would suffer a -4 attack penalty (for making a nonlethal attack with a weapon), plus an additional penalty for nonproficiency. (I suppose proficiency with staff or club could negate the nonproficiency penalty.) Damage would be 1d6 for a longbow or heavy crossbow, 1d4 for a shortbow or light crossbow, and any damage inflicted would be temporary. (Temporary damage remains for 1 turn.)`,

Bows save as thick wood, and crossbows save as thin wood. (Hoo boy, I can hear keyboards clicking and pencils scratching already.) Crossbows, of course, are built from thicker wood than bows are; however, bows are more supple and simple than crossbows.

            question: `Please settle an argument. During a battle in which a hill giant held the higher ground, the giant and the party's mage ended up with simultaneous initiative. The giant hurled a boulder, and the mage cast a ***lightning bolt***. My ruling was that both attacks should arrive at their targets simultaneously, all things being equal. Since the trajectory of the boulder was such that it interfered with the path of the ***bolt*** (crossing the middle), I felt that the ***bolt*** should reflect back on the caster. Furthermore, since the ***bolt*** did not discharge on the boulder but merely bounced off, I ruled that the boulder attack could follow through with its successful hit. Thus, dead mage. Did I handle this properly?`,
            answer: [
                `Of course you handled things correctly—your'e the DM.`,
                `On the other hand, you made a series of implausible rulings that all went against the players, which is not healthy for a campaign. In general, ranged attacks should not affect each other. (Longtime "Sage Advice" readers will recall an old discussion of shooting ***fireballs*** out of the air with ***magic missile*** spells, and a more recent discussion of the fine "art" of arrow catching.)`,
                `Let's consider a few things:`,
                `First, ***lightning bolts*** rebound of unyielding barriers. Hurled weapons, even giant hurled boulders, are not unyielding barriers. In fact, a ***lightning bolt*** probably should have blasted the boulder to bits and continued merrily on its way.`,
                `Second, you decided that the boulder and the ***bolt*** struck home at the same time. This is a fine way to interpret simultaneous initiative. You seem to have failed to consider that a ***lightning bolt*** moves, well, at the speed of lightning and that a boulder is not quite so fast.`,
                `Third, you also did not consider that the ***lightning bolt*** travels in an absolutely straight line while the boulder has a curved trajectory—perhaps rather eccentrically curved if the boulder was not perfectly round.`,
                `So, given the difference in speeds and paths it's extremely unlikely that the boulder and the ***bolt*** would meet. (The boulder would have been about to strike the mage as the bolt went arcing underneath to hit the giant.) As it happens, the game does have ways to account for such rare occurrences. The two that apply in this case are the giant's attack roll and the giant's saving throw. Had the giant's boulder attack missed, it would be perfectly OK to account for that by saying the ***lightning bolt*** blasted it out of the sky. (That's why the game uses attack rolls, to account for all the variables an attacker cannot control.) Likewise, if the giant had made a successful saving throw against the ***lightning bolt***, you might have attributed that to a little interference from the boulder.`,
                `In any case, you allowed a monster to evade an area effect spell by chucking a rock at it—not something you should repeat unless you want your players to start trying the same thing.`

            question: `I write as one who is constantly feeling low and dejected because his NPCs' best-laid plans are constantly being foiled by those quasi-artifacts, ***scarabs of protection***. It is difficult to adjudicate when and where a ***scarab*** will have an effect and when it will not. For example, an NPC wizard cast an ***Otiluke's acid cloud*** spell at the party. The spell inflicts 4d6 points of damage (no saving throw) and requires a saving throw for equipment. One of the party members had a ***scarab of protection***. The player claimed that, since the spell didn't require a saving throw, the ***scarab*** allowed the character a saving throw, which, if successful, would keep the character's items safe. Is that right? Also, what should Ido about spells like ***Melf's acid arrow*** and items with special abilities such as ***vorpal blades*** or ***cubes of force***? What about special monster powers like a demilich's power to drain a soul? This power says that nothing but an ***amulet of life protection*** can stop it.`,
            answer: [
                `A careful reading of the ***scarab of protection*** item description makes it pretty clear that scarab's power to grant a saving throw when none is possible applies only to spells. It is reasonable to extend the protection to spell-like abilities, but not to non-spell-like abilities such as breath weapons, diseases, or demilich soul draining. Nor does the ***scarab*** help a character avoid natural mishaps such as starving to death or dying of old age. The ***scarab*** also does not grant protection from weapon special abilities, magical barriers, or the indirect effects of spells. For example, a ***scarab*** wearer cannot see through magical darkness, hear while inside a ***silence*** spell, or walk through a ***wall of force***.`,
                `The ***scarab*** will prevent damage caused directly by a spell. For example, if the ***scarab*** wearer is struck by a ***Melf's acid arrow***, he gets one chance to make a successful saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell causes no harm to the character or to his equipment. If the saving throw fails, the spell works, inflicting damage for multiple rounds and possibly destroying equipment. On the other hand, if a character stands under a 10-ton weight suspended by a rope and a foe uses ***Melf's acid arrow*** to sever the rope, a ***scarab of protection*** won't keep the character from getting squashed.`,
                `Note that a successful saving throw vs. an area of effect spell always keeps a character's equipment safe. So, your player was right about the ***Otiluke's acid cloud*** spell.`

The rules are a bit vague, in my opinion, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could clear things up for us and others who have the same questions. The ***Player's Handbook*** says a potion's effects are unknown until some brave soul tries a small sample. Similarly, the ***DUNGEON MASTER Guide*** says characters must sample from each container to determine the nature of the liquid inside. This method of identification seems to me to be somewhat hit-or-miss in its nature. Suppose a character sips from a vial containing a ***potion of fire resistance***, a potion that lasts for one turn. Short of walking into the party campfire or the fireplace at the local inn within moments of sipping from the vial, how could a character possibly know what the potions effects are? This method of identification would seem adequate for such potions as ***diminution***, ***flying***, and other obvious effects, but woefully inadequate for such ***potions as invulnerability***, ***plant control***, or ***water breathing***, to name just a few.`,

The ***MONSTROUS MANUAL*** book does not define powerless. I suggest that the vampire cannot attack, use spells, use its special abilities, or act other than to make a normal defense (no special bonuses to attackers). It can move 5 feet. If the vampire begins and ends a round in sunlight, it is destroyed. It would be possible for a vampire to step into sunlight and stagger out again without being destroyed, but its progress would be very slow. If the vampire tries this more than once in the same turn, have it make a saving throw vs. death magic on the second and any further attempts to pass through sunlight that turn. If the saving throw roll fails, the vampire collapses upon entering the sunlight and is destroyed after 1 round unless someone pulls it out of harm's way.`,

            answer: [
                `Regeneration from high Constitution will not allow a character to regrow lost limbs, but they can be reattached. Reattachment takes as much time as it would take the character to regenerate 20 points of damage. The regeneration works only as long as the character is alive (once you're dead, you no longer have a Constitution score), so the character is out of luck if her hit points drop to -10 or she loses her head.`

At that time, the character stops losing hit points. Thereafter, the character regains hit points from the ***ring*** until she reaches full hit points.

The rules in the ***Player's Handbook*** do not require a composite bow to use the higher Strength bonus, but there is a clarification in the ***Arms & Equipment Guide*** that does require a composite bow. However, the rules in the ***Arms & Equipment Guide*** seem to overlook the rule that says you don't need a special bow to get bonuses for a non-exceptional Strength score. I recommend that you require a composite bow for Strengths of 18/01 or higher. Use the damage bonus as a multiplier for the price. For example, a Strength score of 18/01 allows a damage bonus of +3, so a composite bow for a character that strong would cost triple the normal price. Note that characters with lower Strength scores could still use the bow, but they would not be able to string the bow, and they would have to apply whatever Strength adjustments they would normally be allowed, not what the bow allows.`

            question: `I have been having some difficulty understanding how the ***antipathy/sympathy*** spell works. First, the wizard decides to affect a specific creature type or "characters" of a particular alignment. Let us assume that the caster selects chaotic evil. Would that casting of the spell affect a tanar'ri? Would a red dragon be affected? Next, the spell description speaks of vibrations that emanate from the target object or area. How far from the object or area do these vibrations extend? The only figure I can find in the spell description is the 30-yard range, which I take to mean that the spell could be cast on a target up to 30 yards away from the caster; this implies nothing about the range of the vibrations. So, how close would a creature have to be from the target area or object before being attracted to or repelled from the target area or object?`,
            answer: [
                `In this case, "character" is synonymous with "creature," so the ***antipathy/sympathy*** spell in your example would affect any creature with a chaotic evil alignment.`,

If you cast the spell around a white dragon's leg, wouldn't the dragon suffer the damage from the ***wall*** and the damage from being 10 and 20 feet away because the dragon is simultaneously touching the ***wall*** and is also 10 and 20 feet away, thanks to its long body?`,

First, I take it that the 1-turn casting process of writing the victim's name on a lead tablet; driving a nail through the tablet; and placing the tablet "within an occupied tomb" must all be accomplished within range of the victim. Is that right? Second, what exactly constitutes an occupied tomb? Is it synonymous with an occupied coffin, or can this spell effectively be cast only when the victim is within 5 yards per level of a graveyard? Third, I take it that once the spell is successfully cast, range no longer matters, and the victim is attacked by the spell even if he gets on a boat and travels hundreds of miles away. Correct?`,
            answer: [
                `I this case, "range" is the distance from the completed tablet and the victim at the time the spell is cast. Once the spell is complete, the distance between the victim and the tablet is irrelevant, although the spell is not effective if the tablet is not on the same plane as the victim. An occupied tomb is any structure that houses the remains of a dead being, which could indeed be as simple as a coffin. Your DM might define "occupied tomb" more strictly. For example, the "tomb" might have to be occupied by a "person" (a humanoid of human size or smaller) or by a being with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Given the spell's rather short range, any fairly low-level caster must be pretty ingenious to use this spell successfully. For example, the caster might have to smuggle a coffin into the victim's basement, lure the victim to a graveyard, or catch the victim at a funeral.`,

Does a ***protection from lightning*** spell protect the statue?`,

                `Items might continue to function when a character is *polymorphed* (the various *polymorph* spell descriptions leave this up to the DM), but they become nonfunctional when a character is petrified.

            answer: [
                `I strongly recommend that creatures know something is up when they make successful saving throws. The creature should be aware of some sort of twinge or unpleasant tingle. Some DMs even allow the subject to make a Spellcraft check to identify the type of spell.`,
                `I also recommend that creatures not notice when they fail their saving throws (at least not while the spell cast on them lasts) unless the spell produces some noticeable physical or sensory effect. (It's pretty hard not to notice a ***fireball*** engulfing you.)`,
                `In the case of ***charm person***, it's a good bet that an intelligent character who has been compelled to do something he wouldn't normally do will know that something was amiss. The less ordinary the subject's actions, the more likely the subject is to realize someone tampered with his mind. For example, if a PC uses a ***charm person*** spell to get a tightfisted merchant to give him a big discount, the merchant should wonder what made him give the PC such a good deal once the spell wears of. The PC should look out for squalls if he ever meets that merchant again.`,
                `On the other hand, the more ordinary the subject's actions, the less likely the subject is to realize he has been enspelled. For example, if a PC ducks into a shop while running from the town guard and uses ***charm person*** to persuade the merchant not to turn him in, the merchant probably will be none the wiser (particularly if the merchant wasn't too honest to begin with). If the PC then buys something from the merchant for a generous sum, the merchant might well remember the PC fondly.`
