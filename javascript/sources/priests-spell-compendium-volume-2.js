These spheres are the building blocks of a divine power's portfolio, and determine which spells are made available to priests of that faith. For the most part, the sphere assignment from the *Players Handbook* are given (the PLAYER'S OPTIONS: *Spells & Magic* assignments are optional.) For the purpose of this series, spheres are grouped into three categories: *Clerical Spheres*, *Druidical Spheres*, and *Specialty Spheres*. In addition, there is an *All* sphere, to which all priests have access.`
