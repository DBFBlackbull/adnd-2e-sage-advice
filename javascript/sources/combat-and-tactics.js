                                `Fatigue is a measure of the character's endurance over a prolonged combat. At the end of each round, the character checks to see if the combat has lasted long enough for him to become fatigued or exhausted.`,

                                `**Bow.** One of the most common weapons throughout history is the bow. The simple self bow, or short bow, has been used for hunting and war since before the dawn of civilization. If a bow is made from a single piece of wood, it is a plain long or short bow; if it is made from laminated horn, wood, bone, or any other materials, it is a composite bow.`,
                                `If a character has an unusually low Strength score, he *must* apply any attack or damage penalties to his archery. He is forced to use bows that have a lighter pull. However, for a character to gain his bonuses for a high Strength score, he must get a custom-made bow, which costs 3-5 times the normal price. A higher-Strength character can always use a lower-Strength bow, gaining bonuses up to the maximum permitted by the bow. For example, a character with a Strength of 18/35 can use a bow made for a Strength of 17, gaining a +1 to hit and +1 to damage instead of his normal full bonuses.`
