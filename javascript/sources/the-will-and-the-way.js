He could also scan a point "10 miles directly west" or "two miles north of the central square of Urik" if he had ever been to the square.

For example, a slave named Serak has an Intelligence of 13. a Wisdom of 15, and a Constitution of 14. The total is 42, so his psionic potential is a 12.

The victim must save versus death each time a score is drained to 2 or less or die. Serak can be drained for 33 points, which exhausts 100% of his psionic potential and forces a saving throw versus death. Nine more points can be drained, but each point that reduces an ability to 2 or less forces Serak to make another saving throw.`,
